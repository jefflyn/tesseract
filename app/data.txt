The Monkey
Level 5
rom the beginning of time, a rock had sat
high on top of a mountain. The sun, the
moon, Heaven, and Earth all worked their
magic on the rock. One day the rock split
open. Inside was a monkey.
The monkey stood up and stretched.
Suddenly powerful light shot from his eyes.
For a moment the light reached the Cloud
Palace in Heaven.
F The Jade Emperor, ruler of Heaven, sat
up. He turned to one of his captains, who was
standing nearby.
“Find out what caused that light,” said the
emperor.
“Yes, Your Majesty,” said the captain.
The captain rushed out of the hall. He
looked out the southern gate of Heaven
and saw the monkey on Earth below. The

light was gone. But the captain had magical
sight. He could see everything that had just
happened.
“Interesting,” said the captain.
“Well?” said the Jade Emperor when the
captain returned. “What caused the light?”
“It was a monkey,” said the captain.
“A monkey?” asked the Jade Emperor.
“Yes,” said the captain. “He’s on the
Fruit and Flower Mountain, down on Earth.
There had been a rock on the mountain. The
monkey came from the rock. The light shone
from the monkey’s eyes.”
The emperor thought for a moment and
then shrugged. “I’m not surprised,” he said.
“Amazing things happen when Heaven and
Earth work together.”
As time passed, Monkey learned to walk,

run, and climb. He drank from streams and
ate grasses and leaves. He gathered fruit
and explored caves and mountaintops. He
became friends with all the other monkeys
and apes. At night he slept under a cliff.
One very hot morning, all the monkeys
and apes were playing in the shade.
“It is so hot today!” cried one monkey.
“Let’s play in the stream.”
“Good idea!” said another monkey.
The monkeys and apes ran to the stream.
The water rolled and bounced over the rocks.
The monkeys jumped into the cool water.
Everyone splashed and played.
After a few minutes, one monkey
scratched her head. “We all love this stream,”
she said. “We drink from it. We swim in
it. We know that it flows all the way to the
5 6
ocean. But does anyone know where the
stream begins?”
They all looked at one another and shook
their heads.
“We have nothing to do today,” the monkey
continued. “Why don’t we follow the stream to
find its source?”
“That sounds like fun,” said another
monkey.
“Let’s go!” said a third monkey.
Everyone jumped out of the water. They
ran alongside the stream and swung from tree
to tree. They jumped over rocks and climbed
up steep cliffs. Higher and higher they
went up the mountain until they reached an
enormous waterfall. Mist filled the air. The
water crashed down, roaring like thunder.
“I wonder what’s behind that waterfall,”

said one monkey.
“Me too,” said a second monkey. “But
nobody could jump through it.”
“Whoever can jump through and come
back alive will be our king,” said a gibbon. “Is
anyone brave enough to try?”
All the monkeys and apes looked at one
another. They shook their heads.
“I’m not going to try,” said a tall monkey.
“Me neither,” said a short monkey.
A voice called out, “I’ll do it!”
Everyone moved out of the way as the
speaker stepped forward. It was Monkey.
“Are you sure?” asked the gibbon. “It
looks dangerous.”
Monkey laughed. “I’m not afraid of
anything! And when I come back, I will be
king!”

Monkey took a deep breath and leaped
into the waterfall.
