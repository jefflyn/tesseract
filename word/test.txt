VOCABULARY LIST
Preliminary English Test (PET)

Introduction to the PET Vocabulary List 
The PET Vocabulary List gives teachers a guide to the vocabulary needed when preparing students for the PET 
examination. 
Background to the List 
The PET list was originally developed by Cambridge ESOL in consultation with external consultants to guide 
item writers who produce materials for the PET examination. It includes vocabulary from the Council of 
Europe’s Threshold (1990) specification and other vocabulary which corpus evidence shows is high-frequency. 
The list covers vocabulary appropriate to this level of English and includes receptive vocabulary (words that the 
candidate is expected to understand but which is not the focus of a question), and productive vocabulary (words 
that the candidate needs to know to answer a question). 
The list does not provide an exhaustive list of all words which appear on the PET question papers and 
candidates should not confine their study of vocabulary to the list alone. 
How the List is Updated 
The vocabulary of English changes over time, with words being added and other words falling into disuse. In 
order to maintain its currency, the PET list is updated on an annual basis by the addition and removal of words, 
using a corpus-based approach. Suggested additions to the wordlist are collated and the frequency of these 
words is obtained by reference to established corpora (electronic databases). The corpora in question represent 
receptive and productive language in general contexts. The main corpora used for the validation of the PET 
Vocabulary List are: 
• the Cambridge Learner Corpus (CLC) which includes over 20 million words of written learner English at six 
levels; 
• the British National Corpus (BNC) which includes 100 million words of written and spoken native speaker 
data. 
Organisation of the List 
• Word sets 
Some categories of words a learner at this level might be expected to know are not included in the alphabetical 
list but are listed separately. Words formed with common affixes, some compounds and words from some 
common word sets, e.g. days of the week are described below and in Appendix 1. Although some ‘grammar 
words’ (pronouns, modals, etc.) are included, the ‘Language Specification’ section of the PET Handbook 
(available under ‘Downloads’) should be consulted for a more complete listing.
