[00:28.63]Yep.
[00:31.06]Yep.
[00:33.97]Yep.
[00:39.30]You know what it could be? That damn starter motor.
[00:43.58]You getting good compression?
[00:45.68]Yeah.
[00:47.68]I know what's wrong with it.
[00:49.68]It's a Ford.
[00:51.45]You know what they say Ford stands for, don't you?
[00:54.15]It stands for "Fix It Again, Tony."
[00:57.42]You're thinking of a Fiat, Dale.
[01:00.49]"Fix It Again"...
[01:06.37]I'll tell you what you do.
[01:08.07]You take them spark plugs out, and in that little hole...
[01:10.74]you put oil round there, just like Bobby Unser said:
[01:13.44]"The shock'd go bo-boom," just like that.
[01:17.08]Well, I wish it were that simple, Boomhauer.
[01:20.25]But I'll tell you what my truck really needs.
[01:22.98]Leadership.
[01:24.45]Detroit hasn't felt any real pride...
[01:26.92]since George Bush went to Japan...
[01:29.26]and vomited on their auto executives.
[01:32.16]Who's ready?
[01:38.93]You all catch the Seinfeld show last night?
[01:41.63]- Yep. - Hell, I missed it.
[01:43.80]See that part where dang old George comes in there?
[01:46.94]He talks about tasting his own burp.
[01:48.91]And Kramer comes sliding in just like he always does.
[01:52.18]I tell you what, man, them dang old New York boys.
[01:56.28]Just a show about nothing.
[02:32.25]What you listening to, son?
[02:34.29]I don't think you'd like it.
[02:35.89]Well, why not?
[02:36.96]I like this new generation of music.
[02:41.76]WOMAN: Hello?
[02:44.06]Mother of God! It's all toilet sounds!
[02:47.10]Where did you record this?
[02:48.60]I bought it at the mall.
[02:50.14]It's the Funny Phone Jerks.
[02:51.77]HANK: Let me tell you, Bobby, there's nothing funny about these sounds.
[02:56.01]What that person on your tape has is a medical disorder.
[03:00.21]Now you get ready for the game, okay?
[03:02.35]Yes, sir.
[03:03.55]Yes, sir.
[03:04.25]That boy ain't right.
[03:06.92]
[03:07.92]HANK: Oh, God!
[03:08.92]Luanne, I thought you went home!
[03:11.29]No, Uncle Hank, Mama and Daddy are still fighting.
[03:14.03]Well, you're welcome to stay.
[03:15.99]But for God's sakes, girl, lock the door.
[03:18.80]I've got a minor son living in this house.
[03:24.10]So are you ready to kick some Wildcat butt, Bobby?
[03:28.11]Okay.
[03:29.34]Now don't you worry, son. You just do your best.
[03:32.71]Don't listen to her, Bobby.
[03:34.45]If you want to win, you're gonna have to do better than your best.
[03:38.48]How do I do that?
[03:40.18]You gotta give 110 percent.
[03:43.56]That's what'll give you that winning edge.
[03:45.82]But what if the Wildcats give 110 percent, too?
[03:49.63]Well, then you gotta try even harder.
[03:51.76]How about if Bobby gave 112 percent?
[03:54.77]Sure, that'd work.
[03:56.54]Or maybe 113.
[03:59.64]
[04:00.71]Yeah, yeah, that's even better.
[04:02.87]No, I don't know.
[04:04.24]13 is a very unlucky number.
[04:06.21]Look, we're not talking about 13.
[04:08.58]We're talking about 113.
[04:11.18]And even...
[04:12.68]Okay, give 112, what's the difference?
[04:15.79]Look, Bobby, just do your best, okay?
[04:21.99]HANK: Swing, Bobby! Swing! Swing!
[04:24.50]
[04:26.26]Ball one.
[04:27.23]Good eye, honey, good eye.
[04:30.24]Oh, for crying out loud.
[04:33.94]Bobby, you can't make an omelet without breaking eggs.
[04:37.27]And you can't get on base without taking a swing.
[04:40.51]The pitcher could walk me, couldn't he?
[04:43.32]Don't play lawyer-ball, son.
[04:45.55]Now you hit the next one out of the park.
[04:51.12]HANK: Run!
[04:53.26]Run! Run!
[04:55.19]
[04:58.93]HANK: Look at the batter, boy! Watch the ball!
[05:02.17]Huh?
[05:03.27]What?
[05:04.47]Hey, don't look at me! Keep your eye on the ball.
[05:07.87]Keep my eye on the what?
[05:09.91]Stop looking at me, boy! Watch the ball!
[05:12.68]Can't hear you, Dad!
[05:17.18]
[05:18.28]Don't worry, Bobby. You played a good game.
[05:21.39]I gotta stop in here for a minute, and get me some WD-40 and a tap and die.
[05:30.53]INTERCOM: Manager to Register 47, please.
[05:34.20]I hate this place.
[05:36.80]Excuse me, where is the hardware department?
[05:39.57]Where is the hardware department?
[05:43.91]CLERK: What exactly is it you're looking for?
[05:45.98]The hardware department.
[05:47.88]But are you looking for, like, a tool or something?
[05:50.45]What difference does it make?
[05:53.25]What difference does it make?
[05:55.02]Okay, I'm looking for a tap and die and some WD-40.
[05:58.96]Huh.
[06:00.06]Well, what is it you're trying to do?
[06:01.83]I'm trying to buy a tap and die and some WD-40...
[06:06.06]and get out of this godforsaken store!
[06:08.63]
[06:09.74]And what is a tap and die?
[06:11.20]Okay! Forget it!
[06:12.77]Let's say I want a hammer! Do you know what a hammer is?
[06:16.34]That's what I want! A damned hammer!
[06:18.58]Now where in the hell would I go?
[06:21.05]That's that Hank Hill fella that lives on the block next to us.
[06:24.18]WOMAN 1: Has a temper, doesn't he? WOMAN 2: Sure does.
[06:26.72]Makes you wonder who gave his boy that black eye.
[06:30.26]You're going to have to pay for that, dude.
[06:32.52]HANK: You're fired!
[06:34.93]- Ella says she saw Hank hit his son. - Really?
[06:37.53]Well, I heard he threatened a clerk in Mega Lo Mart with a hammer.
[06:40.23]Did you hear about Hank Hill?
[06:42.27]He beat up his son.
[06:43.50]Some ladies in Mega Lo Mart tried to stop him. He beat them up, too.
[06:46.80]Somebody really ought to report him for the boy's sake.
[06:49.74]ANTHONY: You say he hit his son with a bat?
[06:52.44]No. That is definitely not acceptable.
[06:55.15]I wish I could, ma'am.
[06:56.55]But the regulations say we can't take custody of the boy without an interview.
[07:00.38]Don't you worry. He's in the system now. I am on my way.
[07:08.36]DALE: Hey, I know what's wrong with your truck.
[07:10.56]It's your "pollution control."
[07:13.30]I heard on talk radio you don't even need them.
[07:15.97]They're just an egghead government plot.
[07:18.10]How is cutting down on pollution a government plot, Dale?
[07:21.87]Open up your eyes, man.
[07:23.61]They're trying to control global warming.
[07:25.94]Get it? Global.
[07:28.21]So what?
[07:30.48]That's code for UN commissars telling Americans...
[07:32.75]what temperature it's gonna be in our outdoors.
[07:35.49]I say let the world warm up.
[07:37.19]See what Boutros-Boutros-Ghali-Ghali thinks about that.
[07:41.06]We'll grow oranges in Alaska.
[07:43.90]Dale, you giblet-head, we live in Texas.
[07:47.60]It's already 110 in the summer.
[07:49.67]And if it gets one degree hotter, I'm gonna kick your ass.
[07:54.87]What in God's name is that thumping sound?
[07:59.28]PEGGY: Bobby, why don't you go out and help your daddy?
[08:01.88]You have been watching way too much TV, son.
[08:04.65]Come on, Bobby, up.
[08:06.48]No more TV. Turn it off now.
[08:11.99]God love that poor man.
[08:13.96]
[08:16.46]There. That's better.
[08:26.70]Hello, I'm a social worker with the state.
[08:29.01]Would you mind if I talk to you for a minute?
[08:31.08]PEGGY: Sure. Come on in.
[08:33.45]HANK: Damn it. There it is again.
[08:35.51]Where is that thumping coming from? It's driving me crazy.
[08:40.05]Could be far-off helicopters.
[08:42.25]UN helicopters.
[08:44.49]Dale, what are you doing?
[08:45.99]Give me some light! Now! I can't see!
[08:49.76]My arm!
[08:50.86]My head!
[08:54.60]God!
[08:56.07]Mrs. Hill, would you say your husband has a bad temper?
[08:59.07]Who, Hank?
[09:00.24]No, Hank is as gentle as a lamb.
[09:03.67]Dang, no more bouncing that ball!
[09:07.68]Hank, we have a visitor.
[09:14.15]So your assertion, Mr. Hill...
[09:15.95]is that Bobby got the black eye at his baseball game?
[09:18.76]That is not my assertion. That's what happened.
[09:22.46]- Have you ever hit your son, Mr. Hill? - No!
[09:27.03]HANK: What the heck are you writing?
[09:29.33]All you gotta write is one word, "no"!
[09:31.90]Mr. Hill, I feel that you're coming from an anger mindset.
[09:35.64]And if you're projecting this anger onto me...
[09:37.98]it gives me grave concerns as to how you facilitate...
[09:40.68]your son's growth in private.
[09:42.51]Mister, I have not begun to project my anger onto you.
[09:46.88]ANTHONY: Mrs. Hill, how did you get this here on your forehead?
[09:49.89]This? Bobby threw his baseball at me.
[09:51.92]You threw a baseball at your mother?
[09:54.09]Hank, it was an accident.
[09:56.70]So would this be the same "baseball" that gave Bobby the black eye?
[10:01.57]Dale, you sure you want to be messing with Hank's truck when he's not around?
[10:05.04]DALE: I'm gonna help get him this alternator off.
[10:08.57]Dale, I think you released the brake cable.
[10:11.68]Dale!
[10:12.74]DALE: No, I didn't.
[10:16.05]I guess I better get going.
[10:18.45]I got some edging to do.
[10:22.59]ANTHONY: Do you work outside the home, Mrs. Hill?
[10:24.82]Yes, I do. I'm a substitute Spanish teacher.
[10:27.93]
[10:30.76]And you just have the one son?
[10:33.50]Yeah, we would've liked to have more kids...
[10:35.53]- but Hank has a narrow urethra. - Peggy!
[10:38.50]- In fact, Hank's sperm count... - That's enough.
[10:41.34]What in the hell did you tell him that for?
[10:43.88]He asked me.
[10:44.98]He asked you how many kids we have. He didn't ask you about my glands.
[10:49.41]Please, Mr. Hill, loud is not allowed.
[10:53.05]What the..."Loud is not allowed"?
[10:55.62]Now you listen to me, mister.
[10:57.46]I work for a living. And I mean real work.
[11:00.36]Not writing down gobbledygook.
[11:02.83]I provide the people of this community...
[11:05.36]with propane and propane accessories.
[11:09.03]When I think of all my hard-earned tax dollars...
[11:12.07]going to pay a bunch of little twig-boy bureaucrats like you...
[11:16.17]it just makes me want to...
[11:19.18]God, it just...
[11:21.45]PEGGY: Hank?
[11:22.45]Honey, bring me my BC Headache Powder and a glass of water.
[11:26.75]PEGGY: All right, Hank.
[11:28.42]Now, you listen here. You see that boy?
[11:31.32]That's my boy.
[11:32.76]And if you ever try to take him away, so help me God...
[11:36.26]I'll tear you a new one bigger than the Grand Canyon.
[11:39.80]Now I want you to get out of my house.
[11:42.50]You're not welcome here.
[11:44.00]I mean now, before I give you a black eye! Git!
[11:51.01]DALE: You want to know about ol' Hank?
[11:53.58]Well...
[11:54.71]Hank's got a lot of problems.
[11:57.02]Hey, baby! How about a couple of beers!
[12:00.18]Sorry, sug', I gotta go.
[12:01.55]I got another migraine treatment with John Redcorn.
[12:04.32]DALE: Nancy, you've been going to that healer for 12 years...
[12:07.22]and you still get headaches every night.
[12:09.66]Healing process takes time, honey.
[12:14.33]ANTHONY: Getting back to the Hill family.
[12:16.23]Have you ever seen Hank hit his child, Bobby?
[12:18.54]Hank? No sir, Bobby's his pride and joy...
[12:22.34]because of his narrow urethra.
[12:26.31]- Are you absolutely sure? - 100 percent.
[12:28.51]You can ask my son. He's Bobby's best friend.
[12:31.72]Joseph!
[12:33.02]What is it, Daddy?
[12:34.65]You ever seen Hank hit Bobby?
[12:36.45]No, never.
[12:38.02]See?
[12:39.69]You can just move along now.
[12:41.56]I've been calling y'all better than a month now.
[12:44.40]Gripe about y'all every time that dog crosses the street...
[12:47.20]starts yapping his jaw 24 hours a day, and nobody answered.
[12:50.23]How you supposed to do anything about that dog if you just get on your computer?
[12:54.47]Ain't gonna come over here and shut that dang ol' dog up.
[12:57.24]BOBBY: And then some weirdo came over and was asking us a bunch of questions.
[13:02.01]Yeah, he asked me if your dad ever whupped you.
[13:05.45]- He hasn't, right? - Of course not!
[13:07.78]You know my dad. He's all bark.
[13:10.56]That guy got him mad, though.
[13:12.72]My dad was like, "Get out of my house!
[13:16.46]"My boy ain't much, but he's all I got!"
[13:21.30]You do great impressions.
[13:23.94]Let me try.
[13:25.50]"I'll tear you a new one!
[13:28.24]"When I get my hands on you, you little pea-brain...
[13:32.94]"I'll bust your butt into little pieces!"
[13:36.78]I knew it!
[13:38.98]Good God, Peggy, this was on my Road & Track.
[13:42.82]Luanne! Honey, can we talk to you?
[13:45.89]Wait! Not while I'm here.
[13:49.39]LUANNE: Mama's in jail.
[13:50.90]She was saving a quart of beer for before bed.
[13:53.23]Daddy threw it out. She went after him with a fork.
[13:55.77]The trailer tipped over, everything went upside down.
[13:58.40]It's all gonna be on Real Stories of the Highway Patrol!
[14:01.30]And the wig I styled for the Beauty Academy is ruined.
[14:06.21]What am I gonna do, Uncle Hank?
[14:08.61]
[14:09.85]There, there.
[14:11.18]You can stay with us till your mama comes home.
[14:15.35]You'll style a new wig better than before.
[14:19.86]I'll let you use my tools.
[14:22.89]Thanks, Uncle Hank.
[14:26.23]She has got to go.
[14:31.04]Bobby, are you all right? Come on out.
[14:33.94]I thought I told you to get lost.
[14:35.91]Come on, Bobby.
[14:37.24]I can put you with a nice foster family in North Arlen...
[14:40.21]where you can develop healthy life adaptations.
[14:42.95]And they've got a pool.
[14:44.35]Honey, let's give him Luanne.
[14:46.18]I got a girl in here you can take right now.
[14:49.09]Don't you want to live in a house with a pool?
[14:51.89]No.
[14:52.89]See, twig boy?
[14:54.22]Now get your skinny butt off of my property.
[14:56.83]Bobby, I know you can't talk in front of him.
[15:00.36]HANK: I said git! Get out of here! ANTHONY: Okay.
[15:03.74]- You are out of control! - You're out of control, Twiggy.
[15:12.81]- Thanks for the latte, Kenneth. - Anthony, could I see you a minute?
[15:16.95]So on this Hill family case...
[15:19.05]you couldn't confirm any actual abuse, but you still recommended...
[15:22.32]the state take custody?
[15:23.86]Yeah, I mean, the whole neighborhood was Redneck City.
[15:26.86]Did you see in the report, how he dented my Geo?
[15:29.53]"Redneck City." That's pretty funny.
[15:32.03]- Where you from, son? - Los Angeles.
[15:35.80]Let's see here, "hit by a baseball."
[15:40.04]So...
[15:41.14]How did you like ol' Harvey?
[15:43.67]Who's Harvey?
[15:44.84]He's the Little League coach.
[15:46.98]You did talk to the Little League coach, didn't you?
[15:55.25]Son, have you lost your mind?
[15:58.02]Wait! Dad, you're not supposed to yell at me anymore.
[16:02.33]The guy from the state said...
[16:04.23]your hostility invalidates our parent-child contract.
[16:09.10]You're quoting that twig boy at me?
[16:11.87]Hank, the neighbors.
[16:13.44]Remember, he said, "loud is not allowed," Dad...
[16:16.84]or they'll take me away.
[16:19.34]
[16:20.44]Oh, God.
[16:26.45]Hello?
[16:27.58]BOSS: Is this the Hill residence? Who am I talking to?
[16:30.45]Bobby Hill.
[16:31.69]BOSS: Son, this is the State Social Services.
[16:34.39]We're calling off our investigation of your father.
[16:37.09]The worker that visited you will be leaving the office and going back to LA.
[16:41.50]You please tell your parents we apologize for the misunderstanding.
[16:44.84]Okay. I'll tell them. Bye.
[16:47.34]Bobby, who was that?
[16:50.94]Wrong number.
[17:08.89]LUANNE: I borrowed your truck this morning, Uncle Hank.
[17:10.83]It wouldn't start at first, because of a clogged fuel line, but I blew it clean.
[17:18.17]Hey, Bobby, go plug this in the garage for me.
[17:21.21]BOBBY: Okay.
[17:26.84]Want to see something cool?
[17:32.62]HANK: What in the heck?
[17:33.79]Don't you see I'm working here? Close the dang door.
[17:37.26]Bob, just keep put, stop!
[17:39.39]Stop hitting that button!
[17:40.62]Give me that thing!
[17:41.79]Dad, that's not respectful adult-child growth dialogue.
[17:46.10]I'll give you dialogue...
[17:48.07]that's not coming from a center of anger.
[17:51.47]Please return the garage door...
[17:53.87]to its factory-preset down position!
[17:59.28]That is cool.
[18:05.02]HANK: Bobby, hey!
[18:07.92]Please respect...
[18:10.29]my fence's right to be a fence.
[18:14.29]Now!
[18:19.73]BOBBY: You can't do nothing.
[18:22.93]HANK: Hey! Hey!
[18:24.37]BOBBY: You're all wet, Dad!
[18:29.81]BOBBY: Creak.
[18:33.74]Boing!
[18:34.68]PEGGY: What on God's green earth are you making those noises for?
[18:37.88]They're sound effects, like that guy on Police Academy.
[18:41.29]That's what I'm gonna do when I grow up, I've decided.
[18:43.99]And Dad can't say boo about it.
[18:46.32]PEGGY: Bobby, a man from the Child Protective Services just came by.
[18:50.83]He said that he told you last week that this investigation was off.
[18:57.30]Please don't tell Dad!
[18:59.47]Son, I have to. He's been worried.
[19:01.94]- But I like him better this way. - How come?
[19:04.91]I can make him love me even when I screw up.
[19:08.41]Is that what you think?
[19:13.62]It's hard, Peggy.
[19:15.65]I don't want to lose my little boy, my only son.
[19:19.72]But it's hard.
[19:21.29]Well, you can relax.
[19:22.89]The investigation has been off for a week...
[19:25.73]only, Bobby didn't tell us.
[19:27.70]- I'll kill him! - All right, calm down, honey.
[19:29.70]Now let me explain. He didn't do it to be mean.
[19:33.04]Bobby honestly doesn't think that you love him all the time.
[19:36.04]That's crazy. Of course I love him.
[19:37.94]Very good. Now, say it to Bobby.
[19:40.11]What are you talking about?
[19:41.65]I want you to tell Bobby that your love for him is unconditional.
[19:45.75]I can't say that. I can't!
[19:48.69]You know how I was raised. What my father's like.
[19:52.29]I got my shins blowed off by a Japan man's machine gun!
[19:56.63]So don't come crying to me with your problems!
[20:00.86]Honey, I'm begging you.
[20:02.60]For the sake of this family, you have got to do it.
[20:05.27]He's waiting for you out on the porch.
[20:07.67]Jeez.
[20:08.91]Damn twig boy comes over here...
[20:16.55]You...
[20:18.62]You're my son.
[20:20.99]Well, you know, with everything...
[20:23.79]that entails.
[20:30.70]You know...
[20:31.90]feelings of fondness and more...
[20:37.23]You know what I mean, don't you, boy?
[20:39.70]No.
[20:41.01]
[20:42.34]Well...
[20:45.24]That's a hell of a weird sound. I never made that before.
[20:49.25]I...
[20:50.71]you...
[20:53.08]family.
[20:56.66]HANK: You're not making this easy on me, boy.
[21:00.59]Okay.
[21:02.06]I love you no matter what you do. There!
[21:04.43]Let's go get something to eat!
[21:06.80]I'm not...
[21:08.70]just a big disappointment to you?
[21:11.17]Disappointment? No. You make me proud.
[21:15.07]I've been disappointed by just about everything else in this town.
[21:18.38]But you? Not once.
[21:20.64]Damn it, you're my boy.
[21:23.05]You know better than that.
[21:26.45]ANTHONY: He punched him!
[21:27.58]I knew it! I told them! Did you see that?
[21:29.85]See what, twig boy?
[21:32.46]ANTHONY: Never mind.
