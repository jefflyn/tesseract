Introduction to the Key Vocabulary List
The Key Vocabulary List gives teachers a guide to the vocabulary needed when preparing
students for the Key and Key for Schools examinations.
Background to the list
The Key Vocabulary List was originally developed by Cambridge English in consultation
with external consultants to guide item writers who produce materials for the Key
examination. It drew on vocabulary from the Council of Europe’s Waystage (1990)
specification and other vocabulary which corpus evidence shows is high frequency.
The list covers vocabulary appropriate to the A2 level on the Common European
Framework of Reference (CEFR) and includes receptive vocabulary (words that the
candidate is expected to understand but which are not the focus of a question) and
productive vocabulary (words that the candidate needs to know in order to answer a
question).
The list does not provide an exhaustive list of all words which appear on the Key and Key
for Schools question papers and candidates should not confine their study of vocabulary to
the list alone.
How the list is updated
The vocabulary of English changes over time, with words being added and other words
falling into disuse. In order to maintain its currency, the Key Vocabulary List is updated on
a regular basis, with the decision to add or remove words being informed by reference to
the Cambridge Learner Corpus and English Vocabulary Profile.
The Cambridge Learner Corpus is a collection of over 44 million words of English, based
upon evidence of language use by learners from all over the world and from which the
English Vocabulary Profile has developed. The English Vocabulary Profile shows the
most common words and phrases that learners of English need to know in British or
American English. The meaning of each word or phrase in the wordlists has been assigned
a level between A1 and B2 on the CEFR.
A preview version of the English Vocabulary Profile can be accessed by visiting the
website: http://www.englishprofile.org
Organisation of the list
 Word sets
Some categories of words that a learner at this level might be expected to know, e.g. days
of the week, are not included in the alphabetical list but are listed in Appendix 1. Although
‘grammar words’ (pronouns, modal verbs, etc.) are included, the Language Specifications
section of the Key and Key for Schools Handbooks (available from
www.cambridgeenglish.org) should be consulted for a more complete listing.
 Exemplification
Example phrases and sentences showing how words might be used are given only where
words with different meanings need to be constrained. For example, bank is followed by ‘I
changed my money in a bank’ – this shows that bank is limited to the idea of a financial
institution: candidates are not expected to know other meanings, such as ‘a river bank’.

Vocabulary List
 Multi-word verbs
All multi-word (or phrasal) verbs that a Key or Key for Schools candidate might be
expected to know are included in the list. These verbs include ‘literal’ verbs (i.e. where the
meaning is transparent), e.g. sit down, go out and ‘non-literal’ verbs, e.g. look after, get up.
 Topic lists
In Appendix 2, words have been grouped together under common Key and/or Key for
Schools themes, such as ‘Food and Drink’, ‘House and Home’ and ‘Sport’. Not all the
words in the Topic Lists headings appear on the wordlist.
Unsuitable topics
Cambridge Assessment English examinations must not contain anything that might offend
or upset candidates, potentially affect their performance or distract them during the
examination. A number of ‘sensitive’ topics are considered unsuitable for use in Key and
Key for Schools, for example war and politics, and vocabulary relating to these is not
included in the Key Vocabulary List.
Personal vocabulary
The content of the Key Vocabulary List is general in nature and is unlikely to cover
completely the productive vocabulary that may be required by candidates. Candidates
should know the specific lexis they will need to describe themselves and their lives, for
example hobbies, likes and dislikes.
Abbreviations
Abbreviations used in the Key Vocabulary List are:
abbrev abbreviation or acronym mv modal verb
adj adjective n noun
adv adverb phr v phrasal verb
av auxiliary verb pl plural
Am Eng American English prep preposition
Br Eng British English prep phr prepositional phrase
conj conjunction pron pronoun
det determiner sing singular
exclam exclamation v verb
Summary of points to be noted
 The list does not include every word that may appear on a Key or Key for Schools
paper.
 The list covers receptive and productive vocabulary.
 The list is updated regularly.
