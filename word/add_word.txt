The grumpy goat. The story is about poppy, same their home. Apple train farmer. One morning can asked poppy and Sam, can you clean goody set? Please. Sam was worried, guilty books, grumpy puppy and Sam, when you into the gold pen, guilty, push them over. They closed the gate. We need to put good outside her pen. I have an idea, same offer, go to some bread, go to stay in a pen, poppy, put some fresh grass by the gate. Good, still stay in her pen. I have another idea, say, Sam, I'm going to put on test clothes. Good lines, ten. Sam came back in tense clothes. He didn't food good, she pushed Sam over again. They tried to catch goody with a rope. No, I miss. Good, he chased them and ran out of her pen. Quick, shut the gate. Finally, poppy and Sam could clean goods shed. Then they let her come back in, but she still grumpy. The next morning can took them to the pen, come and see good tea. Goody have a baby then left. She doesn't look grumpy now. It's so sweet.
