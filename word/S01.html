That damn starter motor.<br>  You getting good compression?<br>  Yeah.<br>  I know what's wrong with it.<br>  It's a Ford.<br>  You know what they say
Ford stands for, don't you?<br>  It stands for "Fix It Again, Tony."<br>  You're thinking of a Fiat, Dale.<br>  "Fix It Again"...<br>   I'll tell you what you do.<br>  You take them spark plugs out,
and in that little hole...<br>  you put oil round there,
just like Bobby Unser said:<br>  "The shock'd go bo-boom," just like that.<br>  Well, I wish it were
that simple, Boomhauer.<br>  But I'll tell you
what my truck really needs.<br>  Leadership.<br>  Detroit hasn't felt any real pride...<br>  since George Bush went to Japan...<br>  and vomited on their auto executives.<br>  Who's ready?<br>  <br>  <i>You all catch the Seinfeld show last night?</i><br>  - Yep.
- Hell, I missed it.<br>  <i> See that part where
dang old George comes in there?</i><br>  He talks about tasting his own burp.<br>  And Kramer comes sliding
in just like he always does.<br>  I tell you what, man,
them dang old New York boys.<br>  Just a show about nothing.<br>  <br>  What you listening to, son?<br>  I don't think you'd like it.<br>  Well, why not?<br>  I like this new generation of music.<br>  <br>  <i>WOMAN: Hello?</i><br>  <br>  Mother of God! It's all toilet sounds!<br>  Where did you record this?<br>  I bought it at the mall.<br>  It's the Funny Phone Jerks.<br>  HANK: Let me tell you, Bobby,
there's nothing funny about these sounds.<br>  What that person on your tape has
is a medical disorder.<br>  Now you get ready for the game, okay?<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  Yes, sir.<br>  That boy ain't right.<br>  <i></i><br>  HANK: Oh, God!<br>  Luanne, I thought you went home!<br>  No, Uncle Hank,
Mama and Daddy are still fighting.<br>  Well, you're welcome to stay.<br>  But for God's sakes, girl, lock the door.<br>  I've got a minor son living in this house.<br>  <br>  <i>So are you ready
to kick some Wildcat butt, Bobby?</i><br>  Okay.<br>  Now don't you worry, son.
You just do your best.<br>  Don't listen to her, Bobby.<br>  If you want to win, you're gonna have
to do better than your best.<br>  How do I do that?<br>  You gotta give 110 percent.<br>  That's what'll give you that winning edge.<br>  But what if the Wildcats
give 110 percent, too?<br>  Well, then you gotta try even harder.<br>  How about if Bobby gave 112 percent?<br>  <i>Sure, that'd work.</i><br>  Or maybe 113.<br>  <i></i><br>  Yeah, yeah, that's even better.<br>  No, I don't know.<br>  13 is a very unlucky number.<br>  Look, we're not talking about 13.<br>  We're talking about 113.<br>  And even...<br>  Okay, give 112, what's the difference?<br>  <i>Look, Bobby, just do your best, okay?</i><br>  <br>  <i>HANK: Swing, Bobby! Swing! Swing!</i><br>  <i></i><br>  Ball one.<br>  Good eye, honey, good eye.<br>  Oh, for crying out loud.<br>  Bobby, you can't make an omelet
without breaking eggs.<br>  And you can't get on base
without taking a swing.<br>  The pitcher could walk me, couldn't he?<br>  Don't play lawyer-ball, son.<br>  Now you hit the next one out of the park.<br>  HANK: Run!<br>  <i>Run! Run!</i><br>  <i></i><br>  <br>  HANK: Look at the batter, boy!
Watch the ball!<br>  Huh?<br>  What?<br>  Hey, don't look at me!
Keep your eye on the ball.<br>  Keep my eye on the what?<br>  <i>Stop looking at me, boy! Watch the ball!</i><br>  Can't hear you, Dad!<br>  <br>  <i></i><br>  Don't worry, Bobby.
You played a good game.<br>  <i>I gotta stop in here for a minute, and
get me some WD-40 and a tap and die.</i><br>  <br>  <i>INTERCOM: Manager to
Register 47, please.</i><br>  <i> I hate this place.</i><br>  Excuse me,
where is the hardware department?<br>  Where is the hardware department?<br>  CLERK: What exactly
is it you're looking for?<br>  The hardware department.<br>  But are you looking for, like,
a tool or something?<br>  What difference does it make?<br>  What difference does it make?<br>  Okay, I'm looking for a tap and die
and some WD-40.<br>  Huh.<br>  Well, what is it you're trying to do?<br>  I'm trying to buy a tap and die
and some WD-40...<br>  and get out of this godforsaken store!<br>  <i></i><br>  And what is a tap and die?<br>  Okay! Forget it!<br>  Let's say I want a hammer!
Do you know what a hammer is?<br>  <i>That's what I want! A damned hammer!</i><br>  Now where in the hell would I go?<br>  That's that Hank Hill fella
that lives on the block next to us.<br>  <i>WOMAN 1: Has a temper, doesn't he?
WOMAN 2: Sure does.</i><br>  Makes you wonder
who gave his boy that black eye.<br>  You're going to have to pay for that, dude.<br>  HANK: You're fired!<br>  - Ella says she saw Hank hit his son.
- Really?<br>  Well, I heard he threatened a clerk
in Mega Lo Mart with a hammer.<br>  Did you hear about Hank Hill?<br>  He beat up his son.<br>  <i>Some ladies in Mega Lo Mart tried
to stop him. He beat them up, too.</i><br>  <i>Somebody really ought to report him
for the boy's sake.</i><br>  <i>ANTHONY: You say he hit
his son with a bat?</i><br>  No. That is definitely not acceptable.<br>  I wish I could, ma'am.<br>  But the regulations say we can't take
custody of the boy without an interview.<br>  Don't you worry. He's in the system now.
I am on my way.<br>  <br>  DALE: Hey, I know what's
wrong with your truck.<br>  It's your "pollution control."<br>  I heard on talk radio
you don't even need them.<br>  They're just an egghead government plot.<br>  How is cutting down on pollution
a government plot, Dale?<br>  Open up your eyes, man.<br>  They're trying to control global warming.<br>  Get it? Global.<br>  <i>So what?</i><br>  <br>  That's code for UN commissars
telling Americans...<br>  what temperature
it's gonna be in our outdoors.<br>  I say let the world warm up.<br>  <i>See what Boutros-Boutros-Ghali-Ghali
thinks about that.</i><br>  We'll grow oranges in Alaska.<br>  <br>  Dale, you giblet-head, we live in Texas.<br>  <br>  It's already 110 in the summer.<br>  And if it gets one degree hotter,
I'm gonna kick your ass.<br>  <br>  What in God's name
is that thumping sound?<br>  <br>  PEGGY: Bobby, why don't you go out
and help your daddy?<br>  You have been watching
way too much TV, son.<br>  Come on, Bobby, up.<br>  No more TV. Turn it off now.<br>  <br>  God love that poor man.<br>  <i></i><br>  There. That's better.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hello, I'm a social worker with the state.<br>  Would you mind
if I talk to you for a minute?<br>  <i>PEGGY: Sure. Come on in.</i><br>  HANK: Damn it. There it is again.<br>  Where is that thumping coming from?
It's driving me crazy.<br>  Could be far-off helicopters.<br>  UN helicopters.<br>  Dale, what are you doing?<br>  Give me some light! Now! I can't see!<br>  My arm!<br>  <i>My head!</i><br>  <br>  <i>God!</i><br>  Mrs. Hill, would you say
your husband has a bad temper?<br>  Who, Hank?<br>  No, Hank is as gentle as a lamb.<br>  Dang, no more bouncing that ball!<br>  Hank, we have a visitor.<br>  <i>So your assertion, Mr. Hill...</i><br>  is that Bobby got the black eye
at his baseball game?<br>  That is not my assertion.
That's what happened.<br>  - Have you ever hit your son, Mr. Hill?
- No!<br>  HANK: What the heck are you writing?<br>  All you gotta write is one word, "no"!<br>  Mr. Hill, I feel that
you're coming from an anger mindset.<br>  And if you're projecting
this anger onto me...<br>  it gives me grave concerns
as to how you facilitate...<br>  your son's growth in private.<br>  Mister, I have not begun
to project my anger onto you.<br>  ANTHONY: Mrs. Hill, how did you get this
here on your forehead?<br>  This? Bobby threw his baseball at me.<br>  You threw a baseball at your mother?<br>  Hank, it was an accident.<br>  <i>So would this be the same "baseball"
that gave Bobby the black eye?</i><br>  Dale, you sure you want to be messing
with Hank's truck when he's not around?<br>  DALE: I'm gonna help
get him this alternator off.<br>  <br>  Dale, I think you released the brake cable.<br>  Dale!<br>  DALE: No, I didn't.<br>  I guess I better get going.<br>  I got some edging to do.<br>  ANTHONY: Do you work
outside the home, Mrs. Hill?<br>  <i>Yes, I do. I'm a substitute Spanish teacher.</i><br>  <i></i><br>  And you just have the one son?<br>  <br>  Yeah, we would've liked
to have more kids...<br>  - but Hank has a narrow urethra.
- Peggy!<br>  - In fact, Hank's sperm count...
- That's enough.<br>  What in the hell did you tell him that for?<br>  He asked me.<br>  He asked you how many kids we have.
He didn't ask you about my glands.<br>  Please, Mr. Hill, loud is not allowed.<br>  What the..."Loud is not allowed"?<br>  <i>Now you listen to me, mister.</i><br>  I work for a living. And I mean real work.<br>  Not writing down gobbledygook.<br>  <i>I provide the people of this community...</i><br>  with propane and propane accessories.<br>  <br>  When I think of all my
hard-earned tax dollars...<br>  going to pay a bunch
of little twig-boy bureaucrats like you...<br>  it just makes me want to...<br>  God, it just...<br>  <br>  PEGGY: Hank?<br>  Honey, bring me my BC Headache Powder
and a glass of water.<br>  PEGGY: All right, Hank.<br>  Now, you listen here. You see that boy?<br>  <i>That's my boy.</i><br>  And if you ever try to take him away,
so help me God...<br>  I'll tear you a new one
bigger than the Grand Canyon.<br>  Now I want you to get out of my house.<br>  You're not welcome here.<br>  <i>I mean now,
before I give you a black eye! Git!</i><br>  <br>  <i>DALE: You want to know about ol' Hank?</i><br>  Well...<br>  Hank's got a lot of problems.<br>  Hey, baby! How about a couple of beers!<br>  <i>Sorry, sug', I gotta go.</i><br>  I got another migraine treatment
with John Redcorn.<br>  DALE: Nancy, you've been going
to that healer for 12 years...<br>  and you still get headaches every night.<br>  Healing process takes time, honey.<br>  <br>  <i>ANTHONY: Getting back to the Hill family.</i><br>  Have you ever seen Hank
hit his child, Bobby?<br>  Hank? No sir, Bobby's his pride and joy...<br>  because of his narrow urethra.<br>  <br>  - Are you absolutely sure?
- 100 percent.<br>  You can ask my son.
He's Bobby's best friend.<br>  Joseph!<br>  What is it, Daddy?<br>  You ever seen Hank hit Bobby?<br>  No, never.<br>  <i>See?</i><br>  You can just move along now.<br>   I've been calling y'all
better than a month now.<br>  Gripe about y'all every time
that dog crosses the street...<br>  starts yapping his jaw 24 hours a day,
and nobody answered.<br>  How you supposed to do anything about
that dog if you just get on your computer?<br>  Ain't gonna come over here
and shut that dang ol' dog up.<br>  BOBBY: And then some weirdo came over
and was asking us a bunch of questions.<br>  Yeah, he asked me
if your dad ever whupped you.<br>  - He hasn't, right?
- Of course not!<br>  You know my dad. He's all bark.<br>  That guy got him mad, though.<br>  My dad was like, "Get out of my house!<br>  "My boy ain't much, but he's all I got!"<br>  <br>  You do great impressions.<br>  Let me try.<br>  "I'll tear you a new one!<br>  "When I get my hands on you,
you little pea-brain...<br>  <i>"I'll bust your butt into little pieces!"</i><br>  I knew it!<br>  <i>Good God, Peggy,
this was on my Road & Track.</i><br>  Luanne! Honey, can we talk to you?<br>  Wait! Not while I'm here.<br>  <br>  LUANNE: Mama's in jail.<br>  <i>She was saving
a quart of beer for before bed.</i><br>  <i>Daddy threw it out.
She went after him with a fork.</i><br>  <i>The trailer tipped over,
everything went upside down.</i><br>  <i>It's all gonna be on
Real Stories of the Highway Patrol!</i><br>  <i>And the wig I styled
for the Beauty Academy is ruined.</i><br>  <i>What am I gonna do, Uncle Hank?</i><br>  <i></i><br>  There, there.<br>  You can stay with us
till your mama comes home.<br>  You'll style a new wig better than before.<br>  I'll let you use my tools.<br>  Thanks, Uncle Hank.<br>  <i>She has got to go.</i><br>  <br>  Bobby, are you all right? Come on out.<br>  I thought I told you to get lost.<br>  Come on, Bobby.<br>  I can put you
with a nice foster family in North Arlen...<br>  where you can develop
healthy life adaptations.<br>  And they've got a pool.<br>  Honey, let's give him Luanne.<br>  I got a girl in here you can take right now.<br>  Don't you want to live
in a house with a pool?<br>  No.<br>  <i>See, twig boy?</i><br>  Now get your skinny butt
off of my property.<br>  Bobby, I know you can't talk
in front of him.<br>  HANK: I said git! Get out of here!
ANTHONY: Okay.<br>  - You are out of control!
- You're out of control, Twiggy.<br>  - Thanks for the latte, Kenneth.
- Anthony, could I see you a minute?<br>  <i>So on this Hill family case...</i><br>  you couldn't confirm any actual abuse,
but you still recommended...<br>  the state take custody?<br>  Yeah, I mean, the whole neighborhood
was Redneck City.<br>  Did you see in the report,
how he dented my Geo?<br>  "Redneck City." That's pretty funny.<br>  - Where you from, son?
- Los Angeles.<br>  Let's see here, "hit by a baseball."<br>  <i>So...</i><br>  How did you like ol' Harvey?<br>  <br>  Who's Harvey?<br>  He's the Little League coach.<br>  You did talk to the Little League coach,
didn't you?<br>  <br>  <br>  <i>Son, have you lost your mind?</i><br>  Wait! Dad, you're not supposed
to yell at me anymore.<br>  The guy from the state said...<br>  your hostility
invalidates our parent-child contract.<br>  You're quoting that twig boy at me?<br>  Hank, the neighbors.<br>  Remember, he said,
"loud is not allowed," Dad...<br>  or they'll take me away.<br>  <i></i><br>  Oh, God.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hello?<br>  <i>BOSS: Is this the Hill residence?
Who am I talking to?</i><br>  Bobby Hill.<br>  <i>BOSS: Son, this is
the State Social Services.</i><br>  <i>We're calling off
our investigation of your father.</i><br>  <i>The worker that visited you will be

we apologize for the misunderstanding.</i><br>  Okay. I'll tell them. Bye.<br>  Bobby, who was that?<br>  Wrong number.<br>  <br>  LUANNE: I borrowed
your truck this morning, Uncle Hank.<br>  It wouldn't start at first, because of
a clogged fuel line, but I blew it clean.<br>  Hey, Bobby, go plug this
in the garage for me.<br>  BOBBY: Okay.<br>  Want to see something cool?<br>  HANK: What in the heck?<br>  <i>Don't you see I'm working here?
Close the dang door.</i><br>  <i>Bob, just keep put, stop!</i><br>  <i>Stop hitting that button!</i><br>  Give me that thing!<br>  Dad, that's not respectful
adult-child growth dialogue.<br>  I'll give you dialogue...<br>  that's not coming from a center of anger.<br>  Please return the garage door...<br>  to its factory-preset down position!<br>  That is cool.<br>  <br>  HANK: Bobby, hey!<br>  Please respect...<br>  my fence's right to be a fence.<br>  Now!<br>  <br>  BOBBY: You can't do nothing.<br>  HANK: Hey!

are you making those noises for?<br>  <i>They're sound effects,
like that guy on Police Academy.</i><br>  That's what I'm gonna do when I grow up,
I've decided.<br>  And Dad can't say boo about it.<br>  <i>PEGGY: Bobby, a man from
the Child Protective Services just came by.</i><br>  He said that he told you last week
that this investigation was off.<br>  <br>  Please don't tell Dad!<br>  <i>Son, I have to. He's been worried.</i><br>  - But I like him better this way.
- How come?<br>  I can make him love me
even when I screw up.<br>  Is that what you think?<br>  <br>  It's hard, Peggy.<br>  I don't want to lose my little boy,
my only son.<br>  But it's hard.<br>  Well, you can relax.<br>  The investigation has been off for a week...<br>  only, Bobby didn't tell us.<br>  - I'll kill him!
- All right, calm down, honey.<br>  Now let me explain.
He didn't do it to be mean.<br>  Bobby honestly doesn't think
that you love him all the time.<br>  That's crazy. Of course I love him.<br>  Very good. Now, say it to Bobby.<br>  What are you talking about?<br>  I want you to tell Bobby
that your love for him is unconditional.<br>  I can't say that. I can't!<br>  You know how I was raised.
What my father's like.<br>  I got my shins blowed off by
a Japan man's machine gun!<br>  <i>So don't come crying to me

you have got to do it.<br>  He's waiting for you out on the porch.<br>  Jeez.<br>   Damn twig boy

this easy on me, boy.<br>  Okay.<br>  I love you no matter what you do. There!<br>  Let's go get something to eat!<br>  I'm not...<br>  just a big disappointment to you?<br>  Disappointment? No. You make me proud.<br>  I've been disappointed
by just about everything else in this town.<br>  But you? Not once.<br>  Damn it, you're my boy.<br>  <i>You know better than that.</i><br>  <br>  ANTHONY: He punched him!<br>  <i>I knew it!

No, you're not old enough for that.<br>  Ringworm test?<br>  <i>What? Sexual Education?</i><br>  - Where'd you get this?
- I told you. At school.<br>  I thought we didn't have to worry
about this until 9th grade health class.<br>  No. The principal wants to teach us
a unit from some course...<br>  they made up in Washington, DC.<br>  Washington? Bobby, go to your room.<br>  Well, what are we gonna do?<br>  Here's the first thing I'm gonna do,
I'll tell you what.<br>  There. No need for Bobby
to get all bothered up learning about sex...<br>  when he can't do a damn thing about it
anyway, at his age...<br>  and with his features.<br>  <i>Besides, it is not up to
the United States government...</i><br>  to be teaching Bobby the facts of life.<br>  That's his parents' job.<br>  I agree. If anybody should teach our boy
about that...<br>  it should be his parents.<br>  <i>Something like that

Nothing much.<br>  I'm a little worried about being a slut.<br>  [Murmurs]<br>  Well, Bobby, your father and I decided
that as your parents...<br>  that you and I should have a little talk
on the subject.<br>  You have noticed, I am sure, that...<br>  there are some pretty big differences
between boys and girls.<br>  I'm sure you know that.<br>  I mean, physically, boys are,
well, they're different.<br>  They have something
that girls do not have.<br>  Yeah.<br>  You know, something...<br>  You mean, a penis?<br>  <i>I didn't take Sex Ed in school.</i><br>  HANK: Come on, Boomhauer,
if you're gonna prune, prune.<br>  The army taught me everything,

bureaucrat regulatory handbook.<br>  <i>Tu-mai-ho, or something like that.</i><br>  And, Dale,
I'd say the same applies to your Joseph.<br>  I'd tear that permission slip up,

teach him what he knows.<br>  [Muttering] You talk about them dang old
condom dispenser with them be.<br>  Put in 50 cents.
And they try to hit that corner...<br>  turn and bang on that thing,
and talking about her needs.<br>  God, no, that's all right. I guess I'll do it.<br>  My daddy told me the facts of life...<br>  when I was Bobby's age,
and I turned out okay.<br>  Yeehaw!<br>  What you crying for, boy?<br>  This is a good show.
This is a damn good show.<br>  Yeah.<br>  That's also how he taught me
about paying taxes.<br>  Well, there used to be a dairy farm
out here somewhere.<br>  Oh, there we go.<br>  Gracie, this is Mr. Hill.<br>  Brought his son over

about that Sex Ed stuff.</i><br>  What do you mean?<br>  All you gotta know is, I took care of it
with one little phone call.<br>  [Chuckling]<br>  Hey, Peg Leg.<br>  That was Bobby's principal.<br>  <i>Some right-wing maniac called the health
teacher with a death threat and she quit.</i><br>  Oh, well.<br>  I'm sure it was just
some harmless nutcase.<br>  <i>Hey, on the bright side, since there's
no one to teach that Sex Ed course...</i><br>  we can put all this ugliness

in front of a class?<br>  Let me see.<br>  <i>"Self-exploration is a perfectly natural
exercise throughout pubescence."</i><br>  What's so hard about that?<br>  Luanne, honey, tell me, what is it like
to live without shame of any kind?<br>  Is it a good feeling?<br>  Yeah, it is.<br>  I guess I am a little jealous.<br>  Things were very different
when I was a girl.<br>  Honey, you're at that special time of life.<br>  The time when a little girl
becomes a woman.<br>  And you start getting a monthly visitor.<br>  Who? Uncle Joe?<br>  My mother gave me this,
and I'm passing it on to you.<br>  <i>"The Loveliness of Woman."</i><br>  There's nothing in here
but pictures of flowers.<br>  I never even kissed a boy until I was 20.
Of course, he's dead now.<br>  Look. Here's a chapter on communicating
your needs to your love partner.<br>  What kind of filth are you reading?<br>  <i>LUANNE: It's Aunt Peggy's Sex Ed book.</i><br>  <i>Say what?</i><br>  Let me take a look at that.
What in the hell?<br>  That is the inside of a womb.
A woman's womb.<br>  My boy is not gonna look at
the inside of a womb.<br>  He's only been out of yours for 11 years.<br>  I think I need some water.<br>  You want my Chandler or my Ross?<br>  Can I shoot him full of BBs?<br>  - Okay.
- Then Ross.<br>  You sure you don't want him?<br>  I'm not gonna need my toys anymore.<br>  <i>After I learn Sex Ed, I'll be too busy dating.</i><br>  Who?<br>  I don't know.
Whoever wants to have sex with me.<br>  HANK: Well, what do you think?
A few more inches?<br>  You might as well.
It's just gonna keep growing.<br>  - Well, so much for my phone call.
- What are you talking about?<br>  <i>DALE: They found some other
depraved harlot to teach that Sex Ed class.</i><br>  - Dale...
- Don't worry, Hank.<br>  I know people who can take care of her,
if you know what I mean.<br>  That woman is my wife.<br>  I thought Peggy was your wife.<br>  <i>Dale, I think he's saying
Peggy's the new Sex teacher.</i><br>  Yeah? What?<br>  - Nothing, I wasn't saying nothing.
- Nothing at all.<br>  Nothing wrong with
a little sexual education.<br>  No, sir, I bet Peggy'll be introducing
some new ideas into the bedroom.<br>  Dale!<br>  I'm just saying, a woman who knows
is the toughest customer.<br>  Maybe you ought to hit the books, too.<br>  HANK: What the hell is wrong with you all?<br>  Nothing, Hank. Just think.<br>  You'll be married to a woman
who knows everything about sex.<br>  I've never been with a woman like that.<br>  Except, of course, a bargirl.<br>  Of course, I don't mean that...<br>  Peggy's a bargirl or nothing like that.<br>  <i>She just knows, you know...</i><br>  what a bargirl knows.<br>  PEGGY: You know, there's a funny thing
happening down at school.<br>  <i>They want me to teach this Sex Ed stuff
to our kids' class, you know.</i><br>  I don't know if I can overcome...<br>  the crippling sense of shame
I got from my mother.<br>  We knew you wouldn't.<br>  Yeah, I've been telling people,
Peggy Hill is not one of those teachers...<br>  that puts all of that intellectual hooey
above common decency.<br>  Well, sometimes a little intellectual hooey
is a good thing.<br>  Look. We all grew up
not knowing the real words for...<br>  your "dinky" and your "woohoo,"
and we turned out fine.<br>  I learned about sex from my mother.<br>  <i>She gave me that wonderful book,
The Loveliness of Woman.</i><br>  - That book is worthless.
- Well, I got a lot out of it.<br>  When my husband would crawl
all over me at night and do his business...<br>  why, I would just close my eyes
and think of them pretty flowers.<br>  Oh, Bonnie. You poor, poor woman.<br>  <i>Hey, Bobby,
your mom's gonna teach Sex Ed.</i><br>  Yeah, I know.<br>  We're gonna get to see her boobs.<br>  <i>So?</i><br>  HANK: Bobby, you're up.<br>  MAN: Come on, Bobby.<br>  Your dad lost his job.<br>  HANK: Run, Bobby! Run! Come on, run!<br>  Don't stop at first base, son!
Go all the way, Bobby!<br>  PEGGY: Go all the way, honey!
BOY: Yeah! Go all the way, you perv!<br>  [Crowd jeering]<br>  [Phone rings]<br>  Hello?<br>  <i>MAN: You don't know who I am,
but I know where you live.</i><br>  <i>And if you teach that Sex Ed class,
so help me, I'll...</i><br>  Dale, is that you?<br>  <i>DALE: Oh, Hank. Can I speak with Peggy?</i><br>  Peggy, it's for you. It's Dale.<br>  Hello, Dale.<br>  <i>DALE: You don't know who I am,
but I know where you live.</i><br>  PEGGY: Boy, you should've
heard Bonnie today.<br>  <i>That woman has got one awful love life.</i><br>  Oh, my God.<br>  Hank, honey...<br>  would you like to rub some
Pretty Feet and Hands on my back?<br>  Isn't that just for your feet and hands?<br>  Well, mainly.
But you could use it everywhere.<br>  HANK: I'll pass.<br>  Well, how about if I put a little
on your elbows?<br>  It'll moisturize and exfoliate.<br>  My elbows are fine.
You never complained about 'em before.<br>  It's just that it's so nice and cooling.
It makes your elbows smooth.<br>  What? Where in the hell are my elbows
gonna be that they need to be smooth?<br>  Honey, I just thought it would be nice,
for later, for us to be all smooth.<br>  I don't mean to be rude or nothing,
but I'll pass.<br>  Look, Hank Hill,
I did not ask to teach this class.<br>  But I am a substitute teacher.<br>  That means I have to be prepared to go
wherever they need teachers most...<br>  at any hour of the day or night,
and teach anything!<br>  From Gym to Home Ec!
I took an oath, darn it!<br>  Excuse me.<br>  And if I start to pick and choose,
the whole system just breaks down.<br>  Yeah, well, you weren't too proud
to pick and choose...<br>  when you had those Randy Travis tickets.<br>  Oh, no. Those poor little kids
never did get to make their clay ashtrays.<br>  Well, they're damn sure gonna know
the 18 stages of arousal...<br>  because Peggy Hill
is gonna teach that class!<br>  PEGGY: This is a diagram of a woman's...<br>  [Peggy stuttering]<br>  Come on, Aunt Peggy. You can do it.<br>  A woman's...<br>  <i>[Sawing]</i><br>  [Grunting]<br>  This is a man's...<br>  <i>[Stuttering]</i><br>  Well, what do you think?<br>  Nice and clean.<br>  <i>But I think old Sigmund Freud
might have a thing or two to say about it.</i><br>  What?<br>  HANK: Oh, no!<br>  Happiness. Ha-penis.<br>  Ha-penis.<br>  Ha-penis.<br>  Penis.<br>  I did it!<br>  Ovaries.<br>  Uvula.<br>  Uterus.<br>  PEGGY: Vagina!<br>  Hey, Hank, I just said...<br>  I heard you. The whole neighborhood
can hear you cussin'!<br>  It's not cussin'
to say the name of a God-given body part.<br>  It is if it's a part of the body
that was meant to be...<br>  concealed by an undergarment.<br>  <i>You're dealing with organs
that people don't want to know about.</i><br>  Bobby ought to know about 'em.<br>  We don't want him growing up
as repressed as we did.<br>  <i>Sure, we do.
I'm drawing the line here, Peggy.</i><br>  <i>My son is not gonna learn this crazy crap.</i><br>  <i>It says here, he can't take the class
without permission of both his parents.</i><br>  Now just hold on.<br>  Are you saying I am not good enough
to teach my own son?<br>  If you do not approve,
you do not have to sign.<br>  And I do not approve. Permission denied.<br>  Damn strapping tape!<br>  Come on, Bobby.
You're coming to work with me.<br>  [Buzzing]<br>  PEGGY: Oh, my.<br>  No, Mr. Hudson.<br>  We don't recommend
using propane to fill party balloons.<br>  We don't recommend
using propane to fill party balloons.<br>  Yeah, it is a gas. But it's in a liquid state.<br>  <i>But you might want
to blow out those candles.</i><br>  I'm gonna have to call you back.<br>  Bobby, hey, that's my work.
Now just sit still, okay?<br>  What do you think Mom's telling
all those guys?<br>  I don't know. I don't want to know.
Just try not to think about it.<br>  Okay.<br>  What do you think Mom's saying to 'em?<br>  I said not to think about it.
Think about something else.<br>  Okay.<br>  Dad, do you ever have sex anymore?<br>  [Hank stuttering]<br>  Well, come on, Bobby,
can't you think of something pleasant?<br>  What do you think Mom's telling
all those guys?<br>  <i>[Students chattering]</i><br>  PEGGY: Good morning, class. Today
we're gonna discuss human relations.<br>  <i>Otherwise known as...</i><br>  human relations.<br>  I am your substitute teacher.<br>  My name is Peggy Hill.<br>  Okey-dokey. Any questions so far?<br>  - Dad?
- What?<br>  I just wanted to say,
you don't have to worry about me...<br>  because I'm never gonna have sex.<br>  Oh, Bobby! Now don't say that!<br>  I thought that's what you wanted.<br>  Well, yes, if you were my daughter.
But you're my son.<br>  Why is it not okay for girls,
but it's okay for boys?<br>  It's called the double standard, Bobby.<br>  Don't knock it. We got
the long end of the stick on that one.<br>  I see. That's why Mom's bad
for talking about sex.<br>  Bobby, look, just because your mom's
been using those words...<br>  <i>doesn't mean she's bad.
She's just trying to do her job.</i><br>  Give the kids the proper names for things.<br>  Imagine how hard that is for your mother,
trying to teach...<br>  <i>a roomful of snickering 5th-graders...</i><br>  the difference between a boy and a girl's...<br>  you know, hook-ups.<br>  That woman's got a lot of guts,
I'll tell you what.<br>  That's Mrs. Peggy Hill.<br>  H-l-L-L.<br>  You can call me Mrs. Hill,
you can call me Peggy or Peggy Hill.<br>  [Whispering] Okay. Come on, Peggy Hill.
You can do this.<br>  Okay, today's subject...<br>  Just have a seat.<br>  I'm sure your teacher can tell you
everything you need to know.<br>  <i>She was Substitute Teacher of the Year,
1996, I understand.</i><br>  All right, class. Let's do it.<br>  <i>Today I'm gonna teach you Sex Ed.</i><br>  It's difficult subject matter.<br>  <i>But if we approach it with common sense...</i><br>  <i>I believe we might learn something
that could enrich our lives.</i><br>  But before we begin, please bring
your permission slips up to my desk.<br>  Those whose parents did not
give you permission to learn with me...<br>  you can read for an hour
in the school library.<br>  <i>- Sorry, Peggy.
- Sorry, Mrs. Peggy Hill.</i><br>  BOBBY: Looks like
it's just you and me, Mom.<br>  Okay, son.<br>  Well, let's begin with the difference

The snipe hunt.<br>  <i>Not gonna sugarcoat it.
Some of you ain't coming back.</i><br>  Those who survive will be
honored members...<br>  <i>of the Order of the Straight Arrow.</i><br>  Those who don't will be dead.<br>  Question. Are you ready?<br>  Yeah!<br>  You flunked the test of silence, Eustace!
Give me your silence stick!<br>  For the rest of your long, miserable life,

and bag some snipe!<br>  [AII yelling]<br>  <i>Snipe!</i><br>  <i>Shut up, Dale. There is no snipe.</i><br>  I heard my dad talking to your dad.<br>  <i>So what are we doing out here?</i><br>  [Muttering] We're gonna get snackered.<br>  I want to get all messed up
and'll just pollute our minds...<br>  is a three cheeks of down wind, man.<br>  [Burps]<br>  When I grow up, I'm gonna drink
this stuff every day, just like my dad...<br>  and fly jets,

a rich millionaire, and have people killed.<br>  I'm gonna sell propane

out of those 12-year-old boys tomorrow...<br>  I tell you what.<br>  But we still get to
play practical jokes, right?<br>  DALE: They're not jokes, Bill.
They're painful lessons.<br>  I thank my father for all
the tricks he played on me.<br>  He taught me the most
wonderful lesson a child can learn.<br>  Never trust nobody.<br>  That's how I know
Bob Dole's been faking that dead arm.<br>  BOOMHAUER: I tell you what you do...<br>  that dang old hand-in-the-water trick
is gonna work every time.<br>  You just put it in the water like that,
and it don't...<br>  you spend the whole dad-gum day like
that, cleaning up that dang old pee-pee.<br>  Yeah. But those are getting tired.
We need some new material.<br>  Dad, can me and Bobby bring
life preservers?<br>  If you want to be sissies.<br>  He said yes.<br>  HANK: Hey, Dale. There's your wife's...
BILL: Healer.<br>  Yeah, John Redcorn.
Let's get some funny Indian stuff to do.<br>  Hey, John Redcorn.<br>  Hank, Dale, Bill, Boomhauer.<br>  <i>John Redcorn, we've got this Order
of the Straight Arrow retreat tomorrow.</i><br>  - And I was wondering...
- I'd be honored to look after your wife.<br>  Well, thanks.<br>  But what I was really wondering...<br>  is if you had some good Indian stuff
for the ceremony around the campfire.<br>  Our rituals are considered sacred
and are passed down only in the Nation.<br>  - Well, that don't bother us.
- Hell, no. We'll take a sacred one.<br>  There is a very ancient ceremony
I learned from my grandfather...<br>  where we call upon
the sacred Wematanye.<br>  And we ask him to breathe life
into our spirit bag.<br>  <i>Let's see. Spirit bags, Wematanye,
funny-Iooking headband.</i><br>  The boys are gonna eat this stuff up.<br>  The spirit bag is very sacred.
You should not make light.<br>  I like how you say everything's sacred.
That's funny, too.<br>  Let's do that, Hank.<br>  I got a bunch of L'eggs tennis socks
we can use for spirit bags.<br>  <i>I got them in the divorce.</i><br>  Now every time she plays,
she gets blisters.<br>  It's been six years, Bill.<br>  <i>Don't you think she'd have
bought some new socks by now?</i><br>  <i>BOBBY: I want to get that
Straight Arrow patch so bad.</i><br>  I'm gonna put it right here,
next to my sewing badge.<br>  It's supposed to be hard.<br>  I heard they make you walk on hot coals.<br>  And then you have to eat them.<br>  Ew!<br>  After you walk on them?<br>  - Hell. That's hot.
- Hell. You're not kidding.<br>  <i>BOBBY: Fu...
PEGGY: Pardonnez me.</i><br>  Did I just hear what I almost heard?<br>  I was gonna say, "Fu-get about it."<br>  <i>Son, Peggy Hill knows half
a swear word when she hears one.</i><br>  Now go to sleep.<br>  You have the coolest mom.<br>  <i>She smells like Miracle Whip.</i><br>  - Hey, guys.
- Hey, Eustace.<br>  - How you doing?
- Hey, "Useless."<br>  Ha ha.<br>  All right, Randy.<br>  Remember, the purpose of this weekend
is to have fun.<br>  <i>Daddy loves you whether
you get your Straight Arrow patch or not.</i><br>  What a load.<br>  Can you imagine how I'd have turned out
if my dad had loved me no matter what?<br>  - Thanks for the bus fare, Aunt Peggy.
- Don't be silly, honey.<br>  It's very important that you be there
for your mama. This is her big day.<br>  Actually, her big day is the sentencing.<br>  - This is just the arraignment.
- Here's a Funsaver.<br>  Take lots of pictures.<br>  PEGGY: Well, okay.<br>  There we go.<br>  Have a good time. Here's a Funsaver.
Take lots of pictures.<br>  Gosh, Peg, if I didn't know better,
I'd think you were anxious to see us go.<br>  Well, that is not true.
You and Bobby are my whole life.<br>  <i>Come on, kids! Let's go!
Everybody in the car! Ándele! Now!</i><br>  HANK: Hold on, boys. Before we go...<br>  we have to ask the great spirit...<br>  Wematanye, to watch over us on this trip.<br>  - Cool, Indian stuff.
- Wematanye.<br>  This trip is about the sacredness
of Mother Earth and all she gives us.<br>  <i>So pee now, because once
we're on the road, we ain't stopping.</i><br>  [Engine starting]<br>  <i>I'll see you Sunday, Peg.</i><br>  Okay. Yeah. All right. Bye-bye.<br>  [Engine stalling]<br>  Damn it. It looks like
we're delayed a couple hours.<br>  I gotta charge up the battery.<br>  [Gasps]<br>  PEGGY: Pop the clutch, hon!<br>  [Peggy grunting]<br>  [Engine starts]<br>  [Tires screeching]<br>  Wematanye. Let's spot license plates.<br>  I see Texas, Wematanye.<br>  Wematanye,
there's another Texas, Wematanye.<br>  - Wematanye, I see Texas, Wematanye.
- Oh, God.<br>  Wematanye, Texas, Wematanye.<br>  Would you guys just shut up?<br>  You didn't say "Wematanye."<br>  Boomhauer, pass them. I got an idea.
Pass 'em up.<br>  [Dale screaming]<br>  Wematanye.
I see Mr. Gribble's butt. Wematanye.<br>  BOOMHAUER: Give them
a little pressed ham.<br>  [Yelling]<br>  RANDY: Wematanye! Texas! Wematanye!
HANK: All right, that's it.<br>  Everybody pile out, right now.<br>  Okay. The 24-hour
oath of silence starts now.<br>  Here are your silence sticks.<br>  <i>Those are Slim Jims.</i><br>  That's what the white man calls them.<br>  Wematanye calls them silence sticks
to test your spirit of shutting up.<br>  Each time you talk, I take a bite.<br>  Talk five times, and you're out.<br>  24-hour silence starting now.<br>  Right now?<br>  Bobby, son, you just talked.<br>  Now, I'll let that pass. But don't talk again.<br>  Thanks, Dad.<br>  <i>Son, give me that Slim Jim.</i><br>  I'm hungry.<br>  No problem.<br>  <i>JOSEPH: Mr. Hill, wake up!</i><br>  That was a test.<br>  Joseph, give Mr. Dauterive
a bite of your silence stick.<br>  <i>Remember, kids, you never know
when you're gonna be tested.</i><br>  Now, who else is hungry?<br>  ALL: I am.
HANK: Gotcha!<br>  Bobby, Randy, Garth,
pass your silence sticks up.<br>  <i>See, kids? It's harder than you think.</i><br>  You don't want to end up like Randy's dad.<br>  My dad's a successful patent lawyer.<br>  Not in the eyes of Wematanye.<br>  I'm still hungry.<br>  <i>- Who wants a dollar? Say "me."
- Me!</i><br>  [Bill laughing]<br>  Well, these things are addictive.<br>  Well, these things are addictive.<br>  Lord, Bobby. Watch out, son.
You've lost more chaws than anybody.<br>  <i>Now don't talk, no matter what.</i><br>  [Dale screaming]<br>  Wematanye!
Mr. Gribble's not wearing his seatbelt...<br>  Bobby! You just got four in a row.<br>  <i>One more bite,
and you can't make Straight Arrow!</i><br>  BILL: I'll take that jerky now.<br>  There it is, boys. The great outdoors.<br>  [Cars honking]<br>  <i>WOMAN: Thanks to our efforts, we have

The brown herbal Ecstasy is bad.</i><br>  <i>Do not, I repeat, do not take
the brown herbal Ecstasy. Thank you all.</i><br>  Oh, man. What kind of
lefty hootenanny is this?<br>  Look at that one, bouncing around
in front of God and everybody.<br>  Would it kill a tree if she wore a bra?<br>  [Radio static]<br>  <i>[Static]</i><br>  <i>[Static]</i><br>  <i>[Static]</i><br>  <i>[Static]</i><br>  [Murmurs]<br>  I'm beginning to think this silence thing

for how dumb we are! It's all a trick.<br>  My dad wouldn't trick us!<br>  "My dad wouldn't trick us."<br>  ALL: Wematanye.<br>  Wematanye. Who wants another beer?
Wematanye.<br>  HANK: I am Kicking Elk.<br>  As long as the sacred fire is burning,
the oath of silence is suspended.<br>  <i>JOSEPH: Thank the Lord.
RANDY: My lips were stuck together.</i><br>  <i>Shut up! I'm talking here.</i><br>  <i>We of the Order of the Straight Arrow
call upon the spirit, Wematanye...</i><br>  protector of the sacred ground
that brings us cool water to drink...<br>  and energy-efficient,
clean-burning propane gas...<br>  for all our sacred heating
and cooking needs.<br>  Wematanye says, "Respect the earth."<br>  <i>She's ours, by God. Our taxes paid for her.</i><br>  Also it says here,

ALL: Amen.<br>  PEGGY: I'd like a room, please.<br>  Name?<br>  <i>I am Senora Rasha Ibenez.

with the deadliest beast in creation.<br>  <i>Those who survive
will be honored members...</i><br>  <i>of the Order of the Straight Arrow.</i><br>  And those who don't will be dead.<br>  [Gasping]<br>  Wematanye, protect us on our hunt.<br>  All right.
This here's your whoop-ass stick...<br>  to beat the snipe back
in case he comes at you.<br>  What does a snipe look like?<br>  It's got red, glowing eyes,
long, crooked teeth, a claw...<br>  and a tail with another claw on the end.<br>  [Gasping]<br>  Easy, Dale. Bill and I'll take the lead.<br>  Boomhauer and Dale will bring up the rear.<br>  Remember, the snipe call is this:<br>  "Woo-Ioo-Ioo, woo-Ioo-Ioo."<br>  HANK: Well, call him out, boys.
He's not just gonna show up.<br>  <i>BOYS: Woo-Ioo-Ioo...</i><br>  - I think I hear him.
- Look out, Bill. He almost got you.<br>  <i>BOYS: Woo-Ioo-Ioo...</i><br>  They'll be out there another hour,
and then we'll go get them.<br>  Boy, this takes me back.<br>  <i>[Screaming]</i><br>  BOBBY: I got one!<br>  I got one!<br>  What the... What are you talking about?<br>  HANK: My Lord! That's a whooping crane.<br>  There's only five of those left in the world.<br>  Well, four now.<br>  Then we should be thankful
we got the opportunity to see one.<br>  Now you done it.
Now you really gone and done it.<br>  What do you mean "you"?
We're all in this together.<br>  No, me and Boomhauer
came on our own trip...<br>  in our own conveyance.<br>  You and I may be acquainted,
but we are not traveling companions.<br>  I am merely here to enjoy Earth Day
and play some hacky sack.<br>  Dale, I'm gonna need you
to give me the keys now.<br>  I can't believe it.<br>  It wasn't your fault, Bobby.
You thought it was a snipe. We all did.<br>  It was. But Wematanye
turned it into a whooping crane...<br>  <i>so I could live
to get my Straight Arrow badge.</i><br>  Bobby, don't you get it?
Your dad made all that up.<br>  There's no such thing as a snipe.<br>  No! My dad is the Arrow leader.<br>  He speaks only with honor.<br>  We'll ditch the carcass
by the interstate in the morning.<br>  Now, let's just go to sleep.<br>  Yes.

for a missing whooping crane.<br>  <i>Well, you see, the bird's tagged
with a little transmitter.</i><br>  And I've tracked it
to within 10 yards of your campsite.<br>  You haven't seen it, have you?<br>  A whooping crane in these parts?<br>  I think I would've noticed
something like that.<br>  - They're pretty rare, aren't they?
- Yes, very rare and beautiful.<br>  <i>Sir, do you know anything about this?</i><br>  Due to one of them
snipe hunts last night...<br>  with them sticks and a bag.<br>  And a then whack, whack.
We'd go "woo-Ioo-Ioo."<br>  Talking about that big mistake, y'all.<br>  Right there in that cooler.<br>  Right there in that cooler.<br>  Well, if you do see anything,
you can contact the ranger station.<br>  How about you boys?<br>  Well, yeah. We saw...<br>  <i>They can't talk for 24 hours.
Order of the Straight Arrow, you know?</i><br>  Got you. I was in the Order myself.<br>  [Mumbling]<br>  <i>The Straight Arrow hasn't changed a bit

We've got to bury that thing fast!</i><br>  We can't just bury it, Dad, remember?<br>  Wematanye wants us to honor
the bird's sacred spirit.<br>  <i>And we will do just that
in the dumpster behind Stuckey's.</i><br>  Now let's get out of here before
someone sees us, okay?<br>  Murderers! I have got to tell the ranger!<br>  - Brock.
- Rasha.<br>  I almost could not get away.<br>  <i>Amigo, it is time for some new zapatos.</i><br>  Or "shoes," as you say in your country.<br>  <i>Senora, I have an Italian mock-alligator
you are going to love.</i><br>  <i>A Size 16 for Senora Ibenez, Triple E.</i><br>  <i>PEGGY: You are a genius. Now this is why
I come to Lubbock's Very Big Shoes.</i><br>  I'll have Chuck and Buzz carry
the box out to the car for you.<br>  I saw him waving it
over his head, really proud.<br>  I also heard that
they were hunting snipe last night.<br>  There is no snipe.<br>  My God. How many more species
have to be wiped out before we learn?<br>  Easy. Don't draw attention.
We're almost there.<br>  We're gonna make it.<br>  What's that flapping sound?<br>  Taste the wind one last time, bird spirit.<br>  Bobby!<br>  There they are, the nature haters!
Let's get them!<br>  <i>[Screaming]</i><br>  [Coughing]<br>  Pull over right here, by that culvert.<br>  Well, we can't stuff this bird in here.
It'll never fit.<br>  You could eat it.<br>  Damn. And I filled up on silence sticks.<br>  Brother Bird, I have given you
a last flight and made my peace with you.<br>  I release your spirit to Wematanye.<br>  Woo-Ioo-Ioo.<br>  Woo-Ioo-Ioo.<br>  <i>HANK: Son, would you please knock it off?
You're driving me nuts.</i><br>  There is no Wematanye.<br>  It's just some damn nonsense we made up
to fill out the weekend.<br>  <i>Tell him, Dale.</i><br>  How do you know my name, crane killer?<br>  I never met any of you people
before in my life.<br>  - Tell him, Bill.
- He's right, Bobby. It's all a crock.<br>  Those spirit bags of yours
are just my ex-wife's old socks.<br>  And by the way, I want them back.<br>  <i>So...</i><br>  everything you said was all a lie?<br>  Yes. That's the secret of the snipe hunt.
That's the whole point.<br>  Oh, I get it.<br>  I guess.<br>  HANK: I didn't mean
to let you down. I just...<br>  When Dale, and Bill, and Boomhauer,
and me went through this as kids...<br>  all the tricks and lies from our dads,
they were part of the experience.<br>  It brought us all together.
You know, us against them.<br>  I don't want to be against you.
You're my dad.<br>  We're supposed to be on the same team.<br>  Of course we're on the same team.
You and me.<br>  And now Team Hill is gonna bury
that whooping crane together...<br>  and get out of this park
without getting caught.<br>  WOMAN: There they are.<br>  <i>Sir, you lied to me.
You lied to this little boy.</i><br>  And I don't know what you did
to this gentleman in his underwear.<br>  I'm gonna have to take you
in to the ranger station.<br>  <i>Son, hand me the bird body.
I need it for evidence.</i><br>  It's a miracle!<br>  Well, I'll be damned.<br>  Wematanye.<br>  I guess knocking a crane unconscious
isn't a crime.<br>  Although it's probably not good for them.
You're free to go.<br>  I knew you wouldn't lie to me, Dad.<br>  That was just the final test.<br>  Wematanye does exist.<br>  The bird was just unconscious, Bobby.<br>  No.<br>  It was dead until I made Wematanye
bring it back to life.<br>  I'm a shaman.<br>  God, my head hurts.<br>  I can heal you, Dad.<br>  BOBBY: Woo-Ioo-Ioo.<br>  <i>Woo-loo-loo.</i><br>  <i>[Sighs]</i><br>  PEGGY: Welcome home, boys.

You been playing this with your feet?<br>  What's that smell?
You been playing this with your feet?<br>  That's cheese, Dad.<br>  Why would there ever be cheese on Betsy?<br>  It's funny. It's a comedy routine.<br>  You know, you play the guitar

Betsy's in front of the airbag.</i><br>  <i>HANK: So, Bobby, we've got
to think of a hero for you.</i><br>  - Do you have a hero, Dad?
- I sure do. And it's Willie Nelson.<br>  How come?<br>  You might say he's been my inspiration.<br>  <i>See, Willie grew up in Texas,

from Country Western...<br>  to Country, to Adult Contemporary...<br>  and that's as far as I'm going.<br>  Here, son. Take a look at that.<br>  <i>That's Willie Nelson's

this is a sweet, sweet guitar.<br>  - Is she for sale?
- Not hardly. Just fix the bridge, Earl.<br>  <i>[Sighing] I didn't think so.</i><br>  Most guys would sell their wives

Come on. Right this minute.<br>  Mexico. I wonder what a wife

I will have to ask Hank.<br>  <i>[Speaking Spanish]</i><br>  He's not treating you right, Peggy.
A delicate flower like you.<br>  Do you want me to kick his ass?<br>  You are so sweet to offer, Dennis.<br>  But Hank would flatten you out like a bug.<br>  No. This is something Peggy Hill

- I don't know.<br>  Just today, he chipped Betsy's bridge,
ran into my truck with the mower...<br>  dinged up my favorite wedge,

ride your mower...<br>  and swing your golf club.<br>  I believe that kid does have a hero.

I need to get on the Nintendo, quick!<br>  Just a minute, Bobby. Get ready to turn.<br>  And turn!<br>  Way to go, Bobby.<br>  Hi, Uncle Hank.<br>  <i>Shut that off!</i><br>  Bobby, stop dancing. Now!<br>  He's not just dancing.<br>  He's firming his thighs
and tightening his buttocks.<br>  Watch your mouth!<br>  [Hank yelling]<br>  HANK: Luanne!<br>  <i>Damn it. Look at this place.</i><br>  LUANNE: What is it, Uncle Hank?<br>  The sofa bed's in the "out" position.<br>  HANK: I can't find nothing in here anymore.
LUANNE: What are you looking for?<br>  HANK: I didn't used to have to be
looking for something.<br>  I'd come into my den and just look.<br>  Look at my different stuff
and get ideas about what I want.<br>  Don't worry, Uncle Hank.
I'll be out of your hair soon.<br>  I think Buckley's going to
ask me to move in.<br>  Isn't it neat?<br>  I'll be going from Daddy to you to Buckley.<br>  Yeah, it's an amazing journey, Luanne.<br>  What about this?
Maybe you want this record?<br>  - No, it doesn't work like that.
- How about this tackle box?<br>  Luanne, what did I just...<br>  Well, that might need reorganizing.<br>  [Motorcycle approaching]<br>  HANK: Get a muffler!<br>  [AII shouting]<br>  BILL: What do you think you're doing?<br>  Why do you let Luanne
go out with that hairball?<br>  <i>It's none of my business.
She's not my daughter.</i><br>  Anyway, Buckley may be dumb as dirt,
but he's her ticket out of my house.<br>  [Tires screeching]<br>  Keep going!<br>  They should be out of my sight by now.<br>  <i>[Shouting]</i><br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  LUANNE: He... I... We... Oh...<br>  [Muttering] Man, them dang old birds,
man, flying low this season.<br>  They's probably dang old awkward, man,
tell you what.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  What the hell was that?<br>  That was a breakup.<br>  At least, that's what it was
the last time I ran into the house crying.<br>  <i>[Sobbing hysterically]</i><br>  [Laughing nervously]<br>  A lot of tears.<br>  Guess what was on sale?<br>  Oh, my Lord! You've been dumped!<br>  There, there. All right.<br>  <i>You tell Aunt Peggy all about it.</i><br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  <i>[Saw running]</i><br>  Fishsticks?<br>  HANK: I was almost killed at work today...<br>  Okay, Hank, please! Try and be sensitive.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  Okay, honey. Go ahead. You let it out.
It is natural.<br>  <i>This is the healing process.</i><br>  [Luanne snorting]<br>  [Luanne sobbing]<br>  <i>[Sighing]</i><br>  - Peggy.
- I had a talk with her today.<br>  <i>We are past the first hump.
So, that leaves only seven more humps.</i><br>  Peggy, I need you to fix her now.<br>  Without my quiet time,
I am not an effective propane salesman.<br>  You can't rush it, Hank.<br>  The formula is,
for however long she was dating him...<br>  that's how long it takes to get over him.<br>  You mean,
we got three more weeks of this?<br>  If you don't fix her, I'll have to.<br>  Honey, I don't think you have
the tools for that job.<br>  - What's that supposed to mean?
- Remember when my aunt died...<br>  and you kept grabbing my waist
and saying, "Let's wrestle"?<br>  Yeah. You told me it helped you.<br>  I did? Well, yes, it did.<br>  <i>- See?
- Lf you really want to help...</i><br>  sometime tomorrow,
tell Luanne she looks pretty.<br>  <i>- What's that got to do with anything?
- She just needs to hear it from a man.</i><br>  Three words, "You look pretty."<br>  And nothing more.<br>  <i>MAN ON TV:
So, what you thinking about, Stu?</i><br>  <i>STU: I'm thinking about flipping that steak.</i><br>  <i>All righty!</i><br>  No! Flip that other one!<br>  <i>ANNOUNCER: Don't go away.</i><br>  <i>We'll be right back
with more of Make a Steak.</i><br>  <i>MALE SINGER: At Mega Lo Mart</i><br>  <i>you're shopping for the rest of your life</i><br>  <i>How you doing out there?
I'm Chuck Mangione.</i><br>  <i>You know, even celebrities
have to hunt for bargains.</i><br>  <i>That's why I go to the Mega Lo Mart,
where shopping feels so good!</i><br>  <i>This week, 12 five-pound bags
of gourmet chocolates for $10.</i><br>  That's Buckley's section.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  You look pretty.<br>  I was dumped!<br>  <i>PEGGY [Flashback]:
Three words, nothing more.</i><br>  <i>"You look pretty." Nothing more.</i><br>  Why aren't you saying anything?<br>  <i>[Stammers]</i><br>  I never liked that Buckley.
You should be happy.<br>  That guy was an annoying,
greasy-headed loser.<br>  I was dumped by a loser.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  Jeez.<br>  Luanne, sometimes,
life throws you a curve ball.<br>  There's two ways you can deal with it.<br>  You can cry,
and that's the path you've chosen...<br>  or you can not cry.<br>  How do you not cry?<br>  Well, instead of letting it out...<br>  try holding it in.<br>  Every time you have a feeling...<br>  just stick it into a little pit
inside your stomach and never let it out.<br>  Are you supposed to have a pain
under your rib?<br>  Yes. That's natural.<br>  The body doesn't want to swallow
its emotions.<br>  But now you go ahead and
put that pain inside your stomach, too.<br>  I think it's working, Uncle Hank.<br>  I feel sick, but not sad.<br>  There you go. Look at my friend, Bill.<br>  He went through
the worst divorce this county's ever seen.<br>  But you never see him crying.<br>  But you never see him crying.<br>  [Bill sobbing]<br>  - I'm scared I'll never find another guy.
- Don't worry about that.<br>  Peggy told me.<br>  If you dated your old boyfriend
for three weeks...<br>  you'll get a new one in three weeks, tops.<br>  LUANNE: Another thing
I hate about Buckley...<br>  he takes me to all-you-can-eat
and says I have to sneak off his plate...<br>  so I just get iced tea.<br>  Then he's too scared
of getting caught to share.<br>  I hate guys like that.<br>  Why do boys with braces
always want to French kiss?<br>  <i>[Stammers]</i><br>  Pass me some more of that cookie dough.<br>  [Moans]<br>  I never knew you could eat it raw.
It's almost as good as ice cream.<br>  They make ice cream
with cookie dough already in it.<br>  Damn, sister. Get me my keys!<br>  [Laughing]<br>  PEGGY: Luanne, where've you been?<br>  - We were supposed to be crying all night.
- I spent the whole day with Uncle Hank.<br>  Luanne, why don't you
go get the fold-out ready?<br>  Okay. Good night,
Uncle Hank and Aunt Peggy.<br>  - Good night. Hank, what did you do?
- I did what you couldn't do.<br>  I'm not saying you're not good
at what you do.<br>  I'm just saying I'm better.<br>  I went in there and fixed her,
like fixing a carburetor.<br>  And you know what?
It was fun. Like fixing a carburetor.<br>  But, Hank, I told you not to meddle.<br>  This is a natural process,
and you cannot manipulate...<br>  You know, you look pretty.<br>  Really?<br>  Oh, Hank.<br>  Well, that's sweet.<br>  - But I mean it. You have got to stop...
- You look pretty, Peg.<br>  Oh, thank you.<br>  [Country music playing in bar]<br>  HANK: You ladies go on ahead.
We've got to help Bill close his jeans.<br>  All right, let's go.<br>  All right, we have to find
a nice boyfriend for Luanne.<br>  That seems like a pile of work
just to get your den back.<br>  Well, it's not about my den.
It's about that poor girl living in my den.<br>  <i>So, what's her type?</i><br>  [Instrumental rock music]<br>  Never mind about her type.
Just find a regular guy.<br>  It's a scientific fact
that women like round, muscular butts.<br>  I'm going to look for a guy
with a round, muscular butt.<br>  Maybe we should split up.<br>  One more thing.
Peggy doesn't know about this.<br>  - Well, you want me to tell her?
- No, Bill.<br>  Just dance with her. Keep her busy.<br>  What? Me? Dancing?<br>  I don't want... I don't know...<br>  My arms around a warm... Okay.<br>  [Country music playing]<br>  Hmm.<br>  No.<br>  Hmm.<br>  Possible.<br>  Dale, I bought you a beer.
Mind if I dance with your wife?<br>  Take her.<br>  <i>Sucker.</i><br>  [Muttering] No, man.
You don't have to worry about that.<br>  You go out with Luanne, she'll go dutch.
There'll be no other way.<br>  Well, you smell nice.
Dance with me, sugar?<br>  I tell you what, it's that dang old CK One,
man, just like catnip.<br>  Hey...<br>  You seem like a regular guy.<br>  - Hey, what's Hank doing over there?
- I don't see him.<br>  <i>Bill, why are you spinning me
into Souvenir Gulch?</i><br>  It's been awhile.
I can't remember all the steps.<br>  Just do what I say, and we'll get along fine.<br>  <i>On three, brush right, then fan left,
and scoop and scrape the sky.</i><br>  - What's your name, son?
- Wade, sir.<br>  - That's some buckle you got there.
- Thank you, sir.<br>  Means a lot coming from a man like you,
who, I can plainly see...<br>  knows a thing or two about buckles.<br>  [Hank stammering]<br>  Well, this round's on me.<br>  And grapevine left, pitch right,
fan, fan, double-dog-down.<br>  <i>Get your kick. Now slap that heel.
Heel, toe, heel, toe...</i><br>  - Quarterback, huh?
- Varsity.<br>  - Love your mama?
- You know I do.<br>  <i>- She cook with a gas range?
- Propane.</i><br>  <i>- I don't know if I'm ready, Uncle Hank.
- Sure you are.</i><br>  And Wade's a catch and a half.
He can run the 40 in under 5 seconds.<br>  - But my heart is telling me...
- Your heart is telling you?<br>  Who's the boss? You or your heart?<br>  You are. Your heart is your employee.<br>  <i>So get your heart off its butt
and back to work.</i><br>  You're right, Uncle Hank.
What am I waiting for?<br>  Let's go get Wade!<br>  [Music stops]<br>  Bill, you need more confidence in yourself.<br>  <i>If you ask Peggy Hill,
you Boot Scoot with the best of them.</i><br>  I don't know...<br>  <i>EMCEE: All right,
this next one's going to be ladies' choice.</i><br>  Excuse me, Bill.<br>  [Music starts again]<br>  Hey, Peggy.<br>  Better than aerobics, huh?
You worked up quite a sweat.<br>  That's not my sweat.<br>  - Where's Luanne?
- Luanne's fine.<br>  <i>She's gonna get a ride home with a friend.
Tush-push on three!</i><br>  And three!<br>  Is Luanne going to marry
her new boyfriend?<br>  Well, you never can tell.
But my guess is, yeah.<br>  BUCKLEY: Luanne!<br>  HANK: That's Buckley!
Those better be for me!<br>  No, they're for me for later.
Where's Luanne?<br>  Luanne is out with her new boyfriend.<br>  <i>She's in love. You blew it, diphead.</i><br>  You can't compete with this new guy.
He's a football player.<br>  And football players
know how to treat women right.<br>  Now get off my lawn, and don't come back.<br>  Why did you send Buckley away?
Luanne wants him back.<br>  Not going to happen.
I found her a new guy.<br>  You broke the rebound rule?
What has gotten into you, Hank?<br>  Well, I was kind of hoping
she might fall in love with Wade.<br>  <i>Hope in one hand and boo in the other.
See which one gets full first.</i><br>  You are out of your depth, Hank Hill.
You've opened a Pandora's Box.<br>  A box that has a sign that reads,
"For Women Only."<br>  <i>As long as it took that river to carve
the Grand Canyon...</i><br>  that is how long women have been learning
to subtly manipulate relationships.<br>  You only think it's easy...<br>  because we make it look easy.<br>  Did you really believe...<br>  you could step in and fix it overnight?<br>  Could you really be such a fool?<br>  Woe is you, Hank Hill. Woe is you!<br>  No! Everything is going to be fine.<br>  Wade's a good guy.
You don't know. He runs fast.<br>  It'll be fine.<br>  [Tires screeching]<br>  What's that?<br>  <i>See? Everything's fine.</i><br>  Good old Wade drove her home.<br>  Look at that, he's fixed his Dodge up
just like Boomhauer's.<br>  PEGGY: Why on earth
would anyone do that?<br>  Boomhauer!<br>  Good night. Thanks for the lift.<br>  No!<br>  HANK: Luanne, what happened to Wade?<br>  Why aren't you with Wade? I want Wade!<br>  <i>As soon as you left,
Wade turned into Mr. Grabby Sam.</i><br>  I think you fixed me up with him
to get your den back.<br>  <i>Thank goodness Boomhauer gave me a lift.</i><br>  A lift? Is that
what they're calling it these days?<br>  You can't trust this guy.<br>  He's a no-good, immoral,
skirt-chasing rascal.<br>  At least you like him better than Buckley.<br>  What are you saying?
He's your new boyfriend?<br>  <i>PEGGY: Hank?
LUANNE: So? What if he is?</i><br>  If he is, he ain't no more!<br>  You can't tell me what to do.
You're not my father.<br>  Yeah, I guess not. Damn straight I'm not.<br>  But while you're under my roof,
I'm your landlord!<br>  And as your landlord,
I forbid you to date Boomhauer!<br>  <i>- Shut up, Hank.
- I can find another roof!</i><br>  I'll stay at Boomhauer's!<br>  - Fine!
- Fine!<br>  Hey, wait, man. This ain't gonna work out...<br>  these little gals coming around here,
flat out no, man.<br>  Thanks, Boomhauer. Let's go.<br>  These dang old women from Mars, man.
I'll tell you what.<br>  Don't go in there, Luanne. I'm warning you.<br>  <i>You'll be sorry!</i><br>  <i>DALE: Damn it! This neighborhood
is turning into Melrose Place.</i><br>  [Leaf blower running]<br>  Hank, it is after midnight!
What the heck are you doing?<br>  Clearing some space for my leaf blower.<br>  Hank, this is not about
the leaf blower, is it?<br>  <i>Sure it is.</i><br>  <i>[Swallowing]</i><br>  - What are you eating?
- Nothing.<br>  You're eating your emotions, aren't you?<br>  Maybe. Who knows?
I don't care. Whatever.<br>  You thought you could fix Luanne
like a flywheel drive plate.<br>  But a flywheel drive plate
doesn't talk back.<br>  Flywheel drive plates do not have feelings.<br>  - Flywheel drive plates...
- I took her in, Peg.<br>  I put a 20-year roof over her head
and a sofa sleeper under the rest of her.<br>  And this is the thanks I get?
Well, no thanks.<br>  [Gulping]<br>  Just face it, Hank Hill.<br>  The only reason you're this upset is
because you care so much about Luanne.<br>  The only thing I care about
is getting my den back.<br>  Boy, I've never been in here before.<br>  It sure is bachelory.<br>  Can I turn this light on?<br>  <i>[Stammering]</i><br>  That's real pretty. Gosh.<br>  You move very fast, Boomhauer, but...<br>  I'm having all these feelings,
and I need just a little time to...<br>  [Door slams]<br>  <i>[Sighs]</i><br>  HANK: Okay, last case of beer.
Let's divvy it up.<br>  BILL: Hey!<br>  <i>It don't split up even anymore.</i><br>  DALE: That one's Boomhauer's.<br>  That cradle robber's
getting none of my beer.<br>  Boomhauer didn't do anything.<br>  Even if he did, why do you care?
Luanne's not your relation.<br>  Hell, she's my wife's brother's daughter.
You can't get any closer than that.<br>  Look, let's just split that six-pack up.
We can each take two.<br>  Tell you what, I'll take the whole thing.<br>  Okay, Mom, let's try a move of my own.<br>  And split kick right, and back...<br>  and split kick left, and sideways shuffle.<br>  Go!<br>  - Are you okay, Bobby?
- Yeah.<br>  Well, it was a nice move.<br>  - Yeah.
- Oh, honey.<br>  - It's just not right without Luanne.
- Yeah.<br>  This was a nice idea, Peg.
Get us out of that house.<br>  <i>Son, they got eight kinds of ketchup here...</i><br>  <i>and three kinds of catsup.</i><br>  BOOMHAUER: I think I'll have
some fried chicken...<br>  <i>a plate of fried chicken, French fries,
and some fried okra.</i><br>  Luanne! And Boomhauer, too.
Well, isn't this a nice surprise?<br>  Is that gravy lumpy tonight?<br>  Hi, Aunt Peggy, Uncle Hank.<br>  I'll take a bowl of the white gravy
and a bowl of brown gravy.<br>  Hey, Dad, it's Luanne, right behind you.<br>  Dad! It's Luanne!<br>  Hey, Dad. Can't you hear me?
Luanne, right behind you!<br>  Hank, man, I don't know what
you're thinking, but you've got to know...<br>  <i>I'm no Woody Allen with that Soon-Li.
Nothing's going to happen.</i><br>  Boomhauer, you're not going
to talk your way out of this one.<br>  - Uncle Hank, I was...
- Don't "Uncle" me anymore, Luanne.<br>  Just come on by tomorrow,
and pick your stuff up.<br>  I got it all boxed and ready to go.<br>  PEGGY: You finally got your wish.<br>  You are going to get your den back.
I hope you're happy.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  HANK: Look, she's crying again.<br>  I guess she just got dumped
by her new boyfriend, Boomhauer.<br>  [Whispering] He didn't dump her, you did.<br>  What was that?<br>  <i>BOBBY: She said,
"Boomhauer didn't dump her, you did!"</i><br>  Pass the catsup.<br>  <i>[Sighs]</i><br>  LUANNE: I came for my stuff.
HANK: It's all in there.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  I was moving stuff around...<br>  and it seems that
the room looks a little better this way.<br>  The bed is even out.<br>  I figure there's no sense
in packing it up night after night.<br>  I love you, Uncle Hank.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  Oh, Lord.<br>  <i>[Sobbing]</i><br>  Is he still looking?<br>  Yeah.<br>  You know, Hank,
maybe it's time to settle this.<br>  Yeah...<br>  I just hate these big emotional scenes.<br>  Well, let's get it over with.<br>  Boomhauer!<br>  Yeah?<br>  HANK: Beer?<br>  Yeah.<br>  That was beautiful.<br>  [Gulping]<br>  [Gulping]<br></table></div><div style="text-align: center;"><h3>  106 - Hank's Unmentionable Problem.srt</h3>  [Theme music]<br>  [Boggle cubes rattling]<br>  PEGGY: How was beauty school, Luanne?<br>  <i>How did the big shampooing final go?</i><br>  Well, I passed Lather, but I failed Rinse.<br>  And then I failed Repeat, too,
because it includes Rinse...<br>  which I don't think is very fair.<br>  HANK: [Muttering] Damn.<br>  Hank, you forgot to flush.<br>  Didn't have to. Didn't do anything.<br>  Oh.<br>  I see.<br>  How long has this been going on?<br>  There's nothing going on, Peg.<br>  - That's the problem.
- How long have you had this problem?<br>  HANK: There is no problem! Please!<br>  This is not something
we need to talk about.<br>  If you do have a problem, I could...<br>  Peggy, please! For God's sakes!<br>  I'm getting a bite.<br>  <i>Is there any chicken-fried steak left?</i><br>  - Here.
- What's this?<br>  It's Megamucil.
I take 10 heaping teaspoons...<br>  and a glass of water daily to stay regular...<br>  I don't want to know that!<br>  Come on, honey.
Look, it is gentle and all-natural.<br>  <i>No! Stop! Please!</i><br>  This is my own private,
personal, private business.<br>  At least drink the water.
If you drink enough water...<br>  it'll flush out your system
and keep it clean.<br>  <i>I'm telling you, it's good for you.</i><br>  Hey, eggs and sausage.<br>  That looks good.
Peggy, where's my breakfast?<br>  - What are these?
- I baked muffins.<br>  <i>So? Good for you. Where's my sausage?</i><br>  Well, we're out of sausage.<br>  Hey, try a muffin. They are oat bran.<br>  <i>Sure.</i><br>  You should eat those, Dad.
They help you make.<br>  Excuse me?<br>  What are you implying?<br>  I thought you were consti...<br>  Where would you get such an idea?
That's ridiculous!<br>  Anyway, that's not something
you should ever know about your father.<br>  It's pretty obvious.<br>  You were in the bathroom
for an hour last night.<br>  No, I wasn't!<br>  Okay, Dad.<br>  Give me that.<br>  [Dog whimpering]<br>  What is it, Ladybird?<br>  <i>You want to go out?

it's something serious?<br>  Well, I'm a meteorologist, not a doctor.<br>  But if I had to make an educated guess...<br>  I'd say he's got polio.<br>  All right, I'm not a meteorologist.
I'm a weather girl.<br>  <i>So, Hank, what's this I hear
about you being backed up?</i><br>  Nothing! What?<br>  Who are you thinking about talking to?
It's not me. I'm fine!<br>  Well, that's not what I heard.<br>  - Heard from who?
- Dale.<br>  - How does Dale know?
- Nancy.<br>  Nancy knows, too?<br>  That Peggy.<br>  Why not just take the door off
the bathroom and put it out on the lawn?<br>  Hank, it happens to everyone
now and then.<br>  There's no reason to be embarrassed.<br>  Maybe I'm not the one
who should be embarrassed.<br>  Did you ever think of that?<br>  Maybe you're going a little too much.<br>  Once every four or five days

a symptom of a more serious condition.</i><br>  <i>I should know.</i><br>  <i>I'm former Surgeon General

Now everybody knows.<br>  Hank, I was worried.<br>  <i>So? Worry to yourself.</i><br>  I'm tired of worrying to myself.
It's better to talk things out.<br>  Not these things. Not toilet things.<br>  All right, Hank, all right.
If it makes you this upset...<br>  I will just sit here silently,
alone with my worries.<br>  Finally!<br>  I'll have some skirt steak, some brisket...<br>  a little piece of that New York steak,
couple of them steak fingers, and a burger.<br>  Hank, please, have just one veggie.<br>  All right.<br>  Put some macaroni and cheese
on there, too.<br>  [Lawnmower running]<br>  Chocolate sauce! Can I have some?<br>  No, Bobby, this isn't ordinary chocolate.<br>  It is a laxative for your father.<br>  Where'd you find this
chocolate sauce, Peg?<br>  It sure is good. Here, Bobby, try some.<br>  Okay, I thought you'd never ask.<br>  Bobby, you know what that is.<br>  <i>So?</i><br>  - What is it?
- Laxative.<br>  You're trying to drug me?<br>  Good God! That's going too far!<br>  Well, you won't talk to me about it.<br>  Now what if it really is something serious,
like polyps, or worse?<br>  You should see a doctor.<br>  <i>Stop making such a big deal out of it.

See you in hell!</i><br>  [Flushing]<br>  <i>[Screams]</i><br>  <i>[Screams]</i><br>  HANK: Occupied!<br>  Hank, you're alive.<br>  Close the damn door.
Can't you see I'm in here, Peg?<br>  Don't. No, don't touch me.
I'm on the john. Get out of here.<br>  Hank, I was so scared. I dreamed you died.<br>  You didn't see a doctor.
You didn't listen to Koop.<br>  Peggy, you're not supposed to see this.<br>  Listen, honey, I love you.
Please, don't die on me.<br>  I love you, too, but...<br>  Jeez. All right, I'll see a doctor,
if you just get out and leave me be.<br>  You will?<br>  Hank, that's wonderful.<br>  Yeah, well, come on. Get a move on.<br>  PEGGY: Thank you.
HANK: Git!<br>  WOMAN: And what exactly are you seeing
Dr. Morley about today?<br>  [Mumbling] Well, I've been...<br>  or actually I haven't been...<br>  You're going to have to speak up.<br>  I need to see him about a problem with...<br>  <i>WOMAN: Sir, just fill this out
and have a seat.</i><br>  [Trumpeting]<br>  Put that down.
You do not know where it's been.<br>  Come on. I'm trying to fill this thing out.<br>  - Hankie?
- Mrs. Maclntosh?<br>  Hank Hill.<br>  Is this your family?<br>  I was your father's third grade teacher.<br>  Why are you here, Hankie?<br>  This is an old person's doctor.<br>  He hasn't been able to take...<br>  A walk. I threw my knee
out playing touch football.<br>  WOMAN: Mr. Hill, I'm sorry, sir.
I cannot read this.<br>  <i>What does it say? "Con"? "Contact"?</i><br>  <i>"Convict"? "Con" what?</i><br>  <i>So, how are we doing today?</i><br>  I'm Dr. Morley. Let's see.<br>  <i>So you're suffering from consumption?</i><br>  PEGGY: Constipation.
DOCTOR: Oh, constipation.<br>  Well, that's quite a different matter.<br>  <i>How long has it been
since your last bowel movement?</i><br>  Well, I usually don't keep track
of that kind of thing, but...<br>  Five days, and Hank's usual schedule
is every two days.<br>  Of course when we were first married,
he'd go every day.<br>  But I spoke to his mom,
who said the most interesting thing.<br>  <i>She said, when he was a teenager...</i><br>  he would be in that bathroom
three or four times a day...<br>  - Peggy!
- Please, Mr. Hill, this is helpful.<br>  Now, your wife is obviously concerned.<br>  And if she's concerned, I'm concerned.<br>  I think we'll do a sigmoidoscopy.<br>  <i>See, honey? Aren't you glad we're here?</i><br>  Mr. Hill, why don't you go ahead
and take off your pants for me, okay?<br>  Why are you stopping?<br>  No sense in doing this now.<br>  I'll just wait until the doctor comes back.<br>  <i>NURSE: Sir, you're gonna need to take
your pants off for Dr. Morley.</i><br>  Okay.<br>  <i>[Sighing]</i><br>  Why, look at that, Peg.<br>  Cotton balls.<br>  White ones.<br>  A whole jar of them.<br>  How many do you think there are in there?<br>  I'll bet 30.<br>  Yep.<br>  30.<br>  Okay, Mr. Hill, why don't you hop on
the table and undo the back of your gown?<br>  We'll have a look at you.<br>  You got all these fancy machines.<br>  Can't you take a picture
through the gown?<br>  It's normal to be
a little frightened, Mr. Hill.<br>  Just turn your face to the wall.<br>  [Knocking]<br>  - You want me to get that?
- No.<br>  Mr. Hill?<br>  <i>Mr. Hill, this is Tasha.
She's a medical student.</i><br>  Would it be all right with you
if she observes the examination?<br>  Well, I guess.<br>  [Elevator dings]<br>  [Woman hyperventilating]<br>  <i>MAN: We made it, honey.
Quick. Sixth floor, Maternity.</i><br>  [Elevator dings]<br>  [Elevator dings]<br>  [Baby crying]<br>  Mr. Hill, this is a special camera...<br>  that we use to get
an inside view of your colon.<br>  HANK: Just kill me now.<br>  Mr. Hill, do you wish a bite plate?<br>  Mom, I'm hungry.<br>  <i>[Screaming]</i><br>  BOBBY: Dad, what are they doing to you?<br>  Bobby, get out of here!<br>  No, Mr. Hill, when a family faces
an illness, all members should be involved.<br>  Remember, they're your get-well team.<br>  - Hey there, ace. Do you like video games?
- Yeah!<br>  Well, this joystick
is just like a video game joystick.<br>  <i>Only my red button fires a real laser.</i><br>  Cool.<br>  [Makes shooting sounds]<br>  Bobby.<br>  <i>Say, you're good.
Maybe you could help us out a little later.</i><br>  Just kidding, Mr. Hill.<br>  Mr. Hill, it doesn't hurt to smile.<br>  It might actually help.<br>  Tasha, you can begin.<br>  <i>DOCTOR: So far this looks normal.</i><br>  Normal?<br>  That's good, right?<br>  Now, this is exciting.<br>  There are so many twists and turns.<br>  I can't wait to see
what's around the next bend.<br>  The colon has to twist and turn
because it's surprisingly long.<br>  You know, Bobby, if I were
to take your grandfather's intestine...<br>  I'm his father.<br>  Your father's intestine
and lay it out in a straight line...<br>  it would go all the way around the earth.<br>  Wow! Really?<br>  Well, that is amazing, Doctor.
You know, I did not know that.<br>  Now, how could that be?<br>  The Earth is 25,000 miles around.<br>  A piece of steak would have
to shoot through your system...<br>  faster than the speed of sound.
That's impossible.<br>  Well, Mr. Hill, there's certainly nothing
going through your intestines that fast.<br>  Hey, I like this.
Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?<br>  Hey, I like this.
Can I be a proctologist when I grow up?<br>  [Machine buzzing]<br>  Mr. Hill, I'm gonna have to ask you
to relax your buttocks for me, please.<br>  [Yawning]<br>  - How are you holding up, Mrs. Hill?
- I'm okay.<br>  I'm just a little uncomfortable
from sitting here for so long.<br>  [Doctor sighing]<br>  DOCTOR: Okay. Let's take
a five-minute break.<br>  Well, Mr. Hill, we're not exactly sure
what's causing your problem.<br>  <i>So at this point, the best option might be
to remove something surgically.</i><br>  I'm sorry. But apparently your low-fat,
high-fiber diet is not working.<br>  Well, maybe Hank just needs
to give his low-fat...<br>  high-fiber diet a little more time.<br>  - Isn't that right, Hank?
- Yes. All right.<br>  Just to be safe, I'll book an operating
room for the end of the week.<br>  Oh, God!<br>  DOCTOR: Don't worry. You know,
it's possible to live a long, healthy...<br>  slightly less active life without a colon.<br>  <i>You just can't wear shorts.</i><br>  "Not Dogs." Now what are these?
Hot dogs?<br>  No. They're Not Dogs.<br>  They're made of tofu.<br>  Tofu? I can't eat that crap.<br>  Then try this Faux Fu.<br>  <i>It's a tofu substitute
for the tofu-intolerant.</i><br>  Now would that be good
for a man who's constipated?<br>  - Peggy!
- Well, I didn't say it was you.<br>  Is this for your husband?<br>  Yes, and we will also take a quart
of your brown rice broth.<br>  Do you have anything that tastes good?<br>  <i>[Sighing hesitantly]</i><br>  No.<br>  Look at this, Uncle Hank.<br>  "Experience moxibustion with Mr. Li.<br>  <i>"Board-certified moxibustionist.</i><br>  <i>"Relieves stress and

PEGGY: Bathroom time.<br>  HANK: All right.<br>  DALE: Hi there, Peggy.<br>  We were wondering if Hank could
come out and help us with my fence.<br>  PEGGY: Oh, I'm sorry, Dale.
Hank is having his bathroom time.<br>  <i>Maybe later.</i><br>  <i>[Snoring]</i><br>  PEGGY: Well, thank you all for coming.<br>  I thought it would help cheer Hank up
to have all of his friends here.<br>  I think he's making a lot of progress.<br>  PEGGY: Where are you going, Hank?
HANK: To the bathroom.<br>  Now just try to relax, Hank.
And concentrate. This could be it.<br>  PEGGY: Come on! Will you hurry up?<br>  Peggy, please.<br>  Come on, Hank.<br>  <i>[Sighs]</i><br>  [Muzak playing]<br>  <i>[Sighs]</i><br>  No, see, what I'm saying is,

- Don't you worry, Hank.<br>  We still have 24 hours
before your appointment.<br>  We're gonna make the most of it.<br>  <i>[Sentimental instrumental music]</i><br>  You know, Hank seems a little down.<br>  Well, he's a shell of a man.<br>  I never thought he'd have the willpower
to give up everything he enjoyed.<br>  That's not Hank. That's me.<br>  If it was up to him, he'd be eating...<br>  burgers in the backyard
with Dale, Bill, and Boomhauer.<br>  He'd still be drinking beer
and shouting at the TV set...<br>  and having a lot of fun and...<br>  Wait here.<br>  <i>- So?
- So what?</i><br>  Well, I heard a...
I mean, I wasn't listening, but I did hear...<br>  Oh, that was my glasses.<br>  Look, honey, we gotta talk.<br>  I know you want to help,
but this is getting out of control.<br>  You can't treat a grown man like a baby.<br>  It ain't right.<br>  I feel like I've been trying
to be someone else lately.<br>  Eating food I don't eat.<br>  And I'm just not gonna do it anymore.<br>  And if I don't ever poop again,
well, that's just gonna be who I am.<br>  I'd rather die with a burger in my colon...<br>  than live and eat Faux Fu.<br>  Hank, I know. And it's okay. You're right.<br>  What?<br>  PEGGY: I'm doing this because
I want you to be around...<br>  as long as possible, because I love you.<br>  But I have to let you be you.<br>  HANK: Oh, Peggy...<br>  <i>I'll still be here for a good long while.</i><br>  PEGGY: I worry.
HANK: I know you do.<br>  PEGGY: That you could...<br>  I know, honey.<br>  And I'm a lucky son of a gun,
I'll tell you what...<br>  to have a woman like you
care so much about me.<br>  I'm gonna be more open...<br>  tell you how I'm doing more...<br>  and let you in.<br>  I just want this moment

BILL: How can you tell?<br>  Japanese guys usually have glasses...<br>  and a suit and a tie, and stuff like that.<br>  Well, a neighbor is a neighbor.<br>  Let's go over and say hi.<br>  Do you reckon they even speak English?<br>  BOOMHAUER: Yeah, man, them Chinese,
you can't understand a word they say.<br>  They just try living
all upside down, what-not.<br>  Hi there, I'm Hank Hill, I live next door...<br>  which means I'm your neighbor,

Nice to meet you.</i><br>  <br>  What the hell are you trying to do?<br>  <i>So are you Chinese or Japanese?</i><br>  I live in California last 20 year,

I'm tired of running!<br>  <br>  Hello, Kahn.<br>  Hank. Oh, damn!<br>  You have damn fine house.<br>  Lead-free since 1988.<br>  This is my wife, Minh,
and daughter, Kahn Jr.<br>  And this is Peggy Hill.<br>  On behalf of Arlen, Texas, I would like
to welcome you to our country.<br>  Please make yourselves at home,
and take off your shoes.<br>  Why? You just shampoo carpet?<br>  Come on, Bobby. Have some seconds.
The girl's lapping you.<br>  I've never had beef chop suey before.<br>  Really? Oh, you poor dear.<br>  You know, I read somewhere...<br>  <i>that in certain parts of China...</i><br>  meat is as scarce as toilet paper.<br>  - Where you read that?
- Who can remember?<br>  As a substitute teacher, I have
to review all sorts of learning materials.<br>  <i>- Maybe it was on a place mat.
- So you're a teacher.</i><br>  Maybe you can tell me
why Arlen test scores are so low.<br>  I know why. It's because Kahn Jr. Not there
to bring up average.<br>  My boy here might not be
the best test-taker...<br>  but he's got near perfect attendance.
Tell them, Bobby.<br>  I hope you all saved some room
for my famous Apple Brown Betty.<br>  The recipe's a closely guarded
family secret...<br>  passed on from my mother's mother,
to my mother, to me.<br>  And someday, I will give it to my Bobby.<br>  - At least the Brown Betty was good.
- You must give me recipe.<br>  Oh, Minh, you know I can't do that.<br>  <i>But what I can do
is offer you some leftovers.</i><br>  <i>Here, now just reheat this
for 10 minutes at...</i><br>  I've already said way too much.<br>  <i>Well, y'all come back now, y'hear?
That's Texan for "sayonara."</i><br>  Oh, my! Peggy Hill,
what big feet you have! Like boat!<br>  That's just the way God made me.<br>  Look at me!
I'm like little girl in Mama shoes!<br>  Okay, bye-bye now!<br>  Honey, she didn't mean anything by it.<br>  You do not come into a woman's home...<br>  and insult her feet! You just don't.<br>  Come on, Peg, remember when
you first moved here from Montana?<br>  You called pop "sody pop."<br>  <i>And you thought 93 in the shade was hot.</i><br>  Our new neighbors are just like you.<br>  All they need is a little bit of time,
and Hank Hill to watch out for them.<br>  Well, do you think my feet are too big?<br>  No, there's just more of you to love.<br>  Ow.<br>  <i>Sorry.</i><br>  <br>  <br>  Be careful, Bobby.
That's one of them Chinese fighting dogs.<br>  No, it's a West Highland Terrier.<br>  <i>- Yeah, that's it. So what's his name?
- Doggie.</i><br>  Yes, Kahn Jr., he's a doggie.
Now can you tell me his name?<br>  He's called "Doggie."<br>  And that's called a doggie, too,
but her name is Ladybird.<br>  <i>She's a purebred Georgia Bloodhound.</i><br>  Her mama tracked down James Earl Ray.<br>  <br>  Aren't kids great?<br>  They're too young
to know about fear or prejudice.<br>  They won't have to learn that
till high school.<br>  There's a real lesson here for all of us.<br>  Move, please, you're standing on my hose.<br>  <br>  Dad, look, Ladybird and Doggie
like each other.<br>  Of course they do, son, they're neighbors.<br>  You know, Kahn, I just found
a breeding partner for my Ladybird.<br>  If you're interested in having
a real American dog, I can give...<br>  What the hell? Get him off of her!<br>  <br>  Your Ladybird, she real slut!<br>  <i>Ladybird is not a slut. She is in heat.</i><br>  Her hormones have overwhelmed
her natural modesty.<br>  For Pete's sake, would you tie up your dog?<br>  <i>You tie your dog. She seduced my Doggie.</i><br>  That's ridiculous, Ladybird can only love
another purebred Georgia Bloodhound.<br>  You know what I think, Hank Hill?
I think you a narrow-minded redneck!<br>  Oh, I get it. Just because I'm from Texas,
I got to be some kind of redneck!<br>  The Chinese and their stupid stereotypes!<br>  Get off my property!<br>  <br>  <i>Sorry, Ladybird, I know you didn't mean...</i><br>  to have relations with that dog.<br>  But I got to tie you up anyway, if only
to protect your virtue and good name.<br>  <br>  <br>  BOOMHAUER: Man.<br>  Well, hey, look at that.<br>  Maybe Kahn'll let you borrow
his sexy little import.<br>  I'd cut my entire quarter acre
with a Lady Bic...<br>  before I'd borrow that man's mower.
I just don't like him.<br>  - Why? Because he's Chinese?
- No.<br>  I thought he was Korean.<br>  What the hell's the difference?<br>  I don't like the man. That has
nothing to do with where he's from.<br>  I'm no redneck.
He could be from Mars, for all I care.<br>  Believe me, Hank,
if Kahn were from Mars, you'd care.<br>  Especially after he's stolen every last drop
of Earth's drinkable water...<br>  to transport back to his home planet...<br>  Mars.<br>  PEGGY: Come on, stop dawdling.
We have to pick up that pizza...<br>  before the cheese gets cold

If we're not there in 30 minutes, it's free.<br>  MINH: Peggy Hill!<br>  LUANNE: Wait! Aunt Peggy, it's Minh!<br>  <i>MINH: Stop.</i><br>  <br>  Why, Minh, I almost did not see you there.<br>  Peggy Hill!<br>  I feel deeply sorry about dinner.<br>  We get off to bad start.
I say things I should only have thought.<br>  Oh, Minh, thank you.<br>  It must've taken a lot of courage
to apologize like that.<br>  And I know.
I was once the new girl in town, myself.<br>  Me, Kahn, Kahn Jr.,
have a barbecue tomorrow.<br>  It mean so much if you come.<br>  Well, thank you, Minh.
We would be honored to come.<br>  If you need any help with the barbecue...<br>  or if you just want to know
what a barbecue is, you give me a call.<br>  Uh-uh, Peggy.<br>  I can't go, I won't.
Not after what he said about Ladybird.<br>  Oh, Hank, come on.
Minh and I just made up.<br>  We have to go, and if you stay home...<br>  people will think you don't like Kahn
because he's Oriental.<br>  That is ridiculous.<br>  I hate the man
because he's rude and nasty.<br>  Not because of what
his people did to us in WW II.<br>  Hank, I know that. But everyone else,
they'll say Hank Hill is a racist.<br>  What the hell kind of country is this,
where I can only hate a man if he's white?<br>  Hank Hill, you will go to that party,
you will pretend to like Kahn...<br>  and you will drink until you actually do.<br>  Go on.<br>  - Howdy, Kahn.
- Howdy, howdy, howdy.<br>  Here you go.<br>  I thought you might enjoy 7.5 gallons
of pure, premium propane.<br>  Are you kidding? No, I cook with mesquite.<br>  Give meat nice taste of wood.<br>  And I cook with propane.
Gives meat nice taste of meat.<br>  - Hank Hill.
- Hey, whatever.<br>  <i>Some cultures like mesquite,
some prefer propane.</i><br>  <i>Doesn't mean we can't all get along.</i><br>  Just because I happen to sell propane
and propane accessories...<br>  Okay, go stick tank on the table.
Keep napkins from blowing away.<br>  <i>- Kahn Souphanousinphone.
- Okay.</i><br>  You honor me by giving me gas.<br>  Doggie's just like me.<br>  He's new in town,
and he's only got one friend.<br>  Yeah.<br>  But at least you're not tied up.<br>  If I were, I'd just dislocate my shoulders
and slip out of the knot.<br>  I'd chew through the leash.
I bet it tastes just like a Bible cover.<br>  Hey...<br>  Let's untie him. They belong together.<br>  And it's fun to watch them play piggyback.<br>  There you go, boy. Go play with Ladybird.
Be with your true love.<br>  <br>  <br>  Wait, come back! You're in love!<br>  KAHN JR: Doggie! No, come back!<br>  Look, it's Peggy Hill! My new best friend!<br>  <i>She's so pretty in her
little yellow sundress.</i><br>  Oh, Minh, you are so sweet.<br>  I could just mix you up in some Jell-O,
and eat you for dessert!<br>  Peggy Hill, look at husbands!<br>  Too bad men don't get along like we do.<br>  We get along. Men stupid, women smart.<br>  The whole world over.<br>  Hey, look what I make,
Peggy Hill Brown Betty.<br>  But that's impossible,
I never gave you the...<br>  Where'd you get my granny's recipe?<br>  I figure it out myself,
and then make it better.<br>  Her recipe missing one thing. Flavor!<br>  - I beg your P?
- I add flavor, nutmeg flavor.<br>  Now taste much better, don't you think?<br>  MINH: Please to try Peggy Brown Betty.<br>  <i>Would you like Peggy Brown Betty?</i><br>  It's tasty, delicious.<br>  To be honest, I have always had trouble
keeping your Brown Betty down...<br>  but this here is pure heaven.<br>  HANK: Those burgers look done to me.
KAHN: Not yet.<br>  - You might want to turn them now.
- Too soon.<br>  Okay.<br>  <br>  - You might want to turn them now!
- No! Please go away.<br>  Please, Kahn, you're burning them.
That's too much char!<br>  <i>Shut mouth and open mouth!</i><br>  Boy, howdy!
That is the best damn burger I ever ate.<br>  <i>Stop! Stop pushing!
There's enough for everyone...</i><br>  if three people go home right now! Joke!<br>  Doggie.<br>  Doggie?<br>  - Kahn Jr?
- Yeah?<br>  - Why are you named "Kahn Jr."?
- My father wanted a boy.<br>  Yeah, so did mine.<br>  My dad is so lame.<br>  He makes me practice violin
five hours a day.<br>  My dad won't let me watch TV
more than five hours a day.<br>  <i>Well, my dad's making me memorize
2,000 words for the SAT.</i><br>  He's such an autocrat.<br>  <i>What's a S- A-T?</i><br>  I tell you, Peggy, there's nothing
these people can't make better.<br>  First the automobile, then the color TV,
and now the hamburger.<br>  How do they do it?<br>  With a dash of nutmeg, Hank!
A dash of nutmeg!<br>  Oh, Peggy Hill!<br>  Your husband like burger so much,
I give you recipe.<br>  Now you can please him.<br>  I don't care what country he's from.<br>  Any man who can make a burger like that
is okay by me.<br>  <br>  You said it!<br>  It was so good, it's almost a shame
to lose it to the process of digestion.<br>  I tell you what,
that dang old onion soup powder, man.<br>  Just put a little bit of that,
you don't need no grilled onions.<br>  How about you, Dale?
How many you got under your belt?<br>  - Zero.
- How come?<br>  I don't eat dog.<br>  Okay, here are the facts as I see them.<br>  - Kahn served you dog.
- Kahn did not serve us dog.<br>  That's just an awful stereotype.
Chinese people don't really do that.<br>  I don't know.<br>  Anyone crazy enough
to put nutmeg in Brown Betty...<br>  well, they'd be crazy enough
to do anything.<br>  <i> Even if they did feed us dog,
you know, who are we?</i><br>  Who are we to judge other cultures?

That woman gave us the recipe.<br>  <i>See, right here. It says

- No, me neither. I think it barbaric.<br>  HANK: How about bed without dessert?
KAHN: Never fail.<br>  Wouldn't figure a child

his kidney was gone.<br>  At the same time, 500 miles away...<br>  a woman in Phoenix contracted diabetes.<br>  I fixed it, Uncle Hank.<br>  [Engine starts]<br>  <i>She purrs just like a dang old kitten.</i><br>  My dad sure knows how to take care

to the Hotel Arlen?<br>  Remember that, Hank?<br>  [Piano playing]<br>  Hank, you won the big game.<br>  <i>So I'm buying you

Where'd you find that?<br>  In Cotton's room, wrapped in his little
bitty pants under a big pile of lies.<br>  Damn it!
I killed a whole day fixing that car.<br>  - I don't understand.
- What is to understand?<br>  Your father disfigured
his own automobile...<br>  just so he could stay here
and drive me crazy.<br>  Peggy, the poor guy just wants
to spend time with us.<br>  And you've made it so hard for him,
he's afraid to ask.<br>  You're right. It's my fault.<br>  Why didn't I serve that poor man
his sausage?<br>  What's the point in arguing?
The car is fixed now.<br>  He'll be out of here tonight.<br>  Aunt Peg, I found this timing belt
in the laundry.<br>  You want me to wash it with the darks?<br>  <i>CHARLIE: Good morning, Angels.</i><br>  <i>Do I have an assignment for you.</i><br>  <i>ANGELS: Good morning, Charlie.</i><br>  Damn!<br>  <i>It's a Shelley Hack!</i><br>  <i>That's like getting a Shemp!</i><br>  What in the hell is going on here?<br>  Where are your pants?<br>  We were hot. Took them off.<br>  A man doesn't have to wear pants
around the house if he doesn't want to.<br>  What you got them
blue jeans on for, Hank?<br>  Let's go. Take them off.<br>  I don't want to take them off.<br>  Bobby, take your daddy's pants off.<br>  PEGGY: Okey-dokey, Cotton,
Hank fixed your car.<br>  I guess you'll be wanting to head back
right now.<br>  HANK: Peggy.<br>  Well, maybe we should think
about getting back, honey.<br>  What did you say? What did you say?<br>  Okay, now, what did you say, baby cakes?<br>  We can leave! Hank fixed the car!<br>  Actually, Luanne fixed it.<br>  [Laughing]<br>  Oh, that's a good one, Hank's wife.<br>  A woman fixing a car.<br>  That's like a pig trying to read.<br>  - Pig?

a few more days.<br>  <i>DEE DEE: Suppertime, Colonel.</i><br>  You forgot my beer.<br>  Go on. Get me my beer, woman.<br>  Mom, I'll take my dinner in here, too.<br>  Bobby, you will not.

- Kitchen!<br>  Hank, for God's sake,
I need a little support here.<br>  Well, Peggy...<br>  it might be nice, for a change,
to have dinner...<br>  in front of the TV.<br>  Go on, woman, get me my dinner.<br>  I don't know where you got the idea
you could slap your mother's behind.<br>  I'll tell you where he got the idea.
Your father.<br>  And it's your fault
for not nipping it in the bud.<br>  What do you want me to do?
I can't change my father.<br>  He certainly won't
listen to me, now, will he?<br>  You're both men.
You're both peacocks. Remember?<br>  What, are you turning into
some kind of feminist?<br>  I am not a feminist, Hank.<br>  I am Peggy Hill,
a citizen of the Republic of Texas.<br>  I work hard, I sweat hard, and I love hard.<br>  I gotta smell good and look pretty
while I'm doing it.<br>  <i>So I comb my hair,
I reapply lipstick 30 times a day.</i><br>  <i>I do your dishes, I wash your clothes,
and I clean the house.</i><br>  Not because I have to, Hank...<br>  but because of a mutual,
unspoken agreement...<br>  that I have never brought up,
because I am too much of a lady.<br>  Thirty times a day?<br>  Yeah, I like it here.<br>  What kind of work can a guy
get in this town?<br>  - Are you allergic to asbestos?
- Hell, no.<br>  HANK: Hey, Dad.<br>  Hey, it if ain't the old grease monkey.<br>  All right, Dad, I need to talk to you
about some of the things...<br>  you've been telling Bobby.<br>  I've been telling Bobby a lot of things.
For example...<br>  I told him how I lost my shins
defending our country.<br>  <i>- You want to hear that story, fatty?
- Sir, yes, sir!</i><br>  HANK: Bill, I'm trying to talk to my...<br>  I was 14. Just a little older than Bobby.<br>  <i>But I knew Uncle Sam needed me.
So I lied and signed up.</i><br>  [Patriotic instrumental music]<br>  <i>And we had beat them Nazis in Italy.</i><br>  <i>Then they shipped us
to the Pacific Theater.</i><br>  <i>A Tojo torpedo sent our troop ship
to the bottom.</i><br>  <i>I could only save three of my buddies.</i><br>  <i>Fatty, Stinky, and Brooklyn.</i><br>  They were like you fellows,
only one of them was from Brooklyn.<br>  <i>Out of the sun came a Tojo Zero
and put 50 bullets in my back.</i><br>  <i>The blood attracted sharks.</i><br>  <i>I had to give them Fatty.</i><br>  Then things took a turn for the worse.<br>  <i>I made it to an island.</i><br>  <i>But it was full of Tojos!</i><br>  <i>They were spitting on the US flag.</i><br>  <i>So I rushed them. But it was a trap.</i><br>  <i>They opened fire and blew my shins off.</i><br>  <i>Last thing I remember, I beat them
all to death with a big piece of Fatty.</i><br>  I woke up in a field hospital.<br>  And they were sewing my feet
to my knees.<br>  Now what was it you wanted to talk

Get over there.<br>  What are you saying, Hank?<br>  Are you siding with your woman?<br>  Look at me, son. Look at my shins!<br>  Look, Dad, I'm sorry about Fatty
and your shins...<br>  but I'm not a kid anymore.<br>  Bobby is my boy.<br>  And I won't let him grow up

all that gobbledygook...<br>  your grandpa told you.<br>  <i>You listen to your mother.
She knows best.</i><br>  But she's a woman.
How could she know better than Grandpa?<br>  Well, because she's a lot smarter
than him, for one.<br>  Your mother's probably got a better head
on her shoulders than anybody in Arlen.<br>  Better than Bill? Or Dale?<br>  Or Boomhauer?<br>  Jeez, Bobby, why not compare her

Thai spicy noodle soup.</i><br>  Tasty and delicious.<br>  <i>I tell you, I hate to see Nancy cooped
up all Sunday, playing that Boggle.</i><br>  It's a beautiful day.<br>  <i>She ought to be outside,
hanging my laundry.</i><br>  <i>ANNOUNCER: Sunday! Sunday!
And Saturday.</i><br>  <i>It's the 9th Annual Dallas Mower Expo.</i><br>  <i>Be there, as the biggest names in mowers
unveil the latest grass-cutting technology.</i><br>  <i>Thrill to the spectacle of
the Snapper Precision-Mowing Team!</i><br>  <i>See King Mulch take on

I guess I win again.<br>  Boy, Aunt Peg, the words I don't know
could fill a dictionary.<br>  The Elks are having a Boggle tournament
to raise bail money for their treasurer.<br>  Maybe you should enter.<br>  Me? Oh, fish. I just play for fun.<br>  Minh, you owe me $13.<br>  Thank you for Boggle lesson, Peggy Hill.
Maybe next week I teach you mahjong.<br>  Bring your checkbook!<br>  Hank, I'm thinking of entering
a Boggle tournament over at the Elks.<br>  Boggle? Boy, the Elks will do
anything for a dollar.<br>  Are they still playing that game where
the cow's gotta drop dung in a square?<br>  Boggle is nothing like Cow Bingo, Hank.
Boggle is a game of wits.<br>  Now, Cow Bingo is a game of strategy.<br>  <br>  Hoo-yeah!<br>  All right, Peggy, I replaced
my watch battery, ate a Cinnabon...<br>  and bought a P-trap.
I can't kill any more time. Let's go.<br>  <i>Shh, Hank. It is only Round 5.</i><br>  <i></i><br>  "Impatient."<br>  Okay, that's time. Pencils down.
Let's tote 'em up.<br>  I hope you don't mind, but I only used
words that appear in Patsy Cline lyrics.<br>  <br>  Okay.<br>  Hoo-yeah!<br>  Boy, that wife of yours is pretty good.<br>  I guess that's why they call her
your better half.<br>  Who calls her that?<br>  They.<br>  And I hope that your leg
gets better real soon...<br>  Zachary Quinn Jr.<br>  <br>  MAN: How does she do it?<br>  LUANNE: Oh, my goodness!
Congratulations!<br>  BOBBY: You won, Mom!<br>  Looks like someone is gonna have to
clear some room on his trophy shelf.<br>  HANK: Hey, easy, Peggy.
That's my MVP trophy.<br>  Mom's trophy is bigger than yours.<br>  Oh, pooh. I don't care about the trophy.<br>  <i>The real honor is getting to represent
Arlen in the State Boggle Championship.</i><br>  <i>You're going to State? That is so exciting!</i><br>  <i>Just like when Uncle Hank went
to State for high school football.</i><br>  Oh, yeah. It's exactly like that, Luanne.<br>  PEGGY: Oh, well, it might not be football,
but there are over 200 competitors...<br>  and you're allowed to bring a coach.
You wanna be my coach?<br>  A Boggle coach? What would I do?<br>  You don't have to do anything.
You just have to be there.<br>  Unless you want me to go off
to Dallas by myself.<br>  Dallas? I don't want you
going to Dallas at all!<br>  That place is crawling
with crackheads and debutantes!<br>  Half of them play for the Cowboys.<br>  <i>Come on, Hank. It's just for the weekend.
We'll be back on Sunday.</i><br>  <i>ANNOUNCER: Sunday! Sunday! Sunday!</i><br>  Guess who's going to the mower show?
If you guess right, you can come with me.<br>  It's you. Right? Did I win?<br>  Am I going?<br>  Boy, how'd you manage
to swing that with Peggy?<br>  <i>She don't like mowers
like we like mowers.</i><br>  <i>Simple. I found
a Boggle tournament in Dallas...</i><br>  to keep her busy,
while we have some real fun.<br>  Check it out, man. Talk about road trip.
The Big D Motel, man.<br>  You're talking about "The biggest names
in mowers and clippers! Be there!"<br>  Man, it's gonna be fun.<br>  <br>  Let's go, Peggy! We gotta get to Dallas
before the gangs wake up!<br>  <i>PEGGY: Hank! Shh! It's 4:00 a.m.</i><br>  Can I go back to bed, Aunt Peggy?<br>  I need to get eight hours of beauty sleep
and then write a paper on it.<br>  In a minute, honey.
Now, it is very important...<br>  that we know we can trust you two.<br>  Now, no parties while we're gone.<br>  Okay.<br>  Bye-bye.<br>   On behalf
of the Arlen Boggle Boosters...<br>  I'd like to present you with this jacket.<br>  Good luck, Peggy! W-l-N!<br>  <i>I promise to make Dairy King,
Mr. Lube, and Rivera Sump Pumps proud!</i><br>  This weekend, Peggy Hill is gonna
put Arlen, Texas, on the map!<br>  Okay, Peggy Hill.
Good luck and maybe goodbye.<br>  Maybe?<br>  Where I come from, either you come home
a winner or you not come home at all!<br>  Good luck, Peggy Hill. Goodbye.<br>  <br>  <i>- What are you watching?
- Risky Business.</i><br>  Luanne, that movie's got bad words
and adult situations.<br>  Not anymore. I rented it at Blockbuster.<br>  I also got a fire-safety video
starring Chuck Mangione! Want to watch?<br>  No, thanks. I'm kinda
in the middle of doing laundry.<br>  Okay. But remember...<br>  Chuck says,
"Always unplug your iron after use."<br>  BOBBY: Thanks for the tip.<br>  It's okay, honey. Valet parking is
included in the price of the room.<br>  I don't like the looks of this one, Peggy.<br>  He's just itching
to take my truck for a joyride.<br>  <i></i><br>  <br>  <br>  PEGGY: Oh, Hank!<br>  <i>It's lovely. Look at that.</i><br>  Look, everyone. It's Peggy Hill.
Boggle champ of Arlen, Texas.<br>  JOAN: I'm Joan,
Boggle Hospitality Coordinator.<br>  Here's your tournament tote bag,
a schedule of events, and a Boggle lei.<br>  <br>  Joan, this is my husband, Hank.<br>  Wonderful! We have tons of activities
to occupy you while Peggy plays Boggle.<br>  You look like you could use a wallet.
Would you like to make a wallet?<br>  I don't think so.
Harley Davidson already made one for me.<br>  Now, Hank is not just my husband.
He is also my coach.<br>  Well, then you'll be needing one of these.<br>  Come on, Peggy. There's a Parker Brother
I want you to meet.<br>  <i>TV: So take it from me, Chuck Mangione...</i><br>  <i>unplugging the iron feels so good!</i><br>  <i>Can you dig it?</i><br>  LUANNE: Bobby, wait! Use a coaster!<br>  Uh-oh.<br>  What have you done?
That coffee table is trashed!<br>  Your parents trusted us, Bobby,
and we let them down.<br>  They won't be home for 48 hours!
I'll think of something.<br>  Hey, I got it! You think of something.<br>  HANK: I'm checking in.
The name's Hank Hill.<br>  - Nope, I have a Peggy Hill.
- Yeah, that's it. Hank and Peggy Hill.<br>  I have a Peggy Hill.<br>  <i>She's my wife!</i><br>  Oh, okay. "Mr. And Mrs. Peggy Hill."<br>  Now, you listen to me!<br>  The name is Hank Hill! Mr. Hank Hill!<br>  Peggy married me! I didn't marry her!<br>  What are you looking at?<br>  Oh, look, Peggy, it's Cissy Cobb...<br>  <i>Boggle champion of Dallas
for seven non-consecutive years.</i><br>  PEGGY: Oh, excuse me, Cissy.<br>  I am fellow Boggle champ, Peggy Hill.<br>  My, my. What an interesting jacket.
Did you patch that together yourself?<br>  Actually, it was given to me
by the Arlen Boggle Boosters.<br>  They got local businesses
to sponsor my trip.<br>  Oh, how exciting.<br>  Why, you're at the very beginning
of a rags-to-riches story.<br>  <br>  BOBBY: Okay. The guy at Home Depot
said all we gotta do...<br>  is strip, sand, varnish, buff, varnish...<br>  <i>buff, varnish, wax, buff.</i><br>  Oh, God! Your parents are gonna
be home in 47 hours! Hurry!<br>  No!<br>  BOBBY: That was close.<br>  BURNETT: Why, hello there, Peggy Hill.<br>  Name's Burnett,
Cissy Cobb's husband-coach.<br>  Actually, my name...<br>  You don't have to explain.
I got an uncle named Leslie.<br>  And the Duke himself, John Wayne,
was really named Marion.<br>  You take that back!<br>  BOBBY: The stain's not coming out!
I'm gonna put it on high.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  PEGGY: Oh, Hank.<br>  I have dreamt of this moment
ever since I reached ages-8-and-up.<br>  <i>Yeah. So I'll see you at dinner.
I gotta get to the mower show.</i><br>  You can't leave now.
You are my coach. I need you.<br>  <i>You, of all people, should understand,
I am at State.</i><br>  This is my moment.<br>  You know, when I close my eyes,
I see myself in the winner's circle.<br>  And you are right there next to me.
My coach. My man.<br>  And we drive back to Arlen
with that big-ass Boggle trophy...<br>  mounted on the hood of your old truck
like some beautiful, gold-plated...<br>  bare-breasted, Rolls Royce angel!<br>  Well, when I close my eyes,
I see myself at the mower show...<br>  and you're there, too,
like some beauty queen of yore...<br>  wearing a fur coat and a gold hat.<br>  Oh, all right! I'll stay.<br>  <i>EMCEE: Coaches, please
clear the gaming floor!</i><br>  Oh, I forgot. Coaches have to watch
from a closed-circuit TV room.<br>  Hold my purse?<br>  Well, hello, Patches.<br>  You must be here for your Boggle lesson.<br>  <i>EMCEE: Bogglers, take your marks!</i><br>  <br>  Oh, yeah.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vowel cubes are running cold.<br>  Coaches note.
It's a good day for "sometimes Y."<br>  Hey, Cobb, for $7.50, I can ride
the mower that cut the Grassy Knoll.<br>  "Patina, pendant, panoply, and lobster."<br>  Cissy Cobb, 73 points!<br>  Peggy Hill, your words, please.<br>  "Dang."<br>  <br>  "Dang" is not a word!
That's just some backwoods patois.<br>  Winner, Cissy Cobb! 73-0.<br>  Dang.<br>  I am so stupid!<br>  Oh, you're not stupid.
Heck, you're smarter than me.<br>  Oh, big deal.<br>  Well, you're smarter
than anyone else in Arlen.<br>  Well, whoop-dee-doo!<br>  I am the smartest hillbilly
in Hillbilly Town!<br>  I'm trying, Peggy, I just...<br>  You know, Coach said something that
would fire us up when we were behind.<br>  Yeah? What?<br>  Loser! You're a loser!
Are you feeling sorry for yourself?<br>  Well, you should be, 'cause you are dirt!
You make me sick, you big baby!<br>  Baby want a bottle? A big dirt bottle?<br>  Why are you yelling at me?<br>  I'm trying to be your coach!<br>  It's inspiring.<br>  Well, thank you.
'Cause I feel worse than ever.<br>  Well, it worked for the team.<br>  <i>PEGGY: No, it didn't.
You went to State and lost.</i><br>  Oh, jeez.
I think I need one of those $8 beers.<br>  PEGGY: You were right, Hank. I am a loser.<br>  I am 255 out of 256.<br>  Oh, come on now.
You're still doing better than...<br>  <i>Boggle Playing Chicken.</i><br>  <i>EMCEE: Coaches!
Please clear the gaming floor.</i><br>  Well, I guess that's my cue.
You want me to hold your purse?<br>  Fine. This shouldn't take
very long anyway.<br>  BILL: Wow, would you look at this place?<br>  I feel like the Pretty Woman.<br>  DALE: Hank?<br>  Oh! Hi, guys.<br>  - What are you doing with that purse?
- I'm holding it for Peggy.<br>  Uh-huh.<br>  Come on, man.
We're missing the mower show! Let's go!<br>  Well, maybe tomorrow.<br>  What's going on here, Hank?<br>  I got a pretty good dang old idea what's
going on. I tell you what, man. It's a...<br>  <br>  Two days ago, you were like a little boy,
all excited about the mower show.<br>  Now, you're this strange man
holding a purse.<br>  Which is it, Hank?<br>  Are you some kind of man?
Or are you a little boy?<br>  I am still a little boy, damn it!<br>  And I am still excited about going
to the mower show. Come on, let's go!<br>  <i></i><br>  <br>  Winner, Peggy Hill!<br>  Oh, I don't believe it!
You played a great game.<br>  <i>ANNOUNCER: And on display in
Booth 5, the blade from Slingblade.</i><br>  DALE: "Liberace's Mower,
no flash photography."<br>  <br>  BOBBY: You sure you can get that
ring out? I can't afford any more screwups.<br>  I just spent my last dollar
on deodorizing carpet sealant.<br>  What color is that? Is that Eggshell White?<br>  <i>It's gotta be Swiss Coffee!</i><br>  Oh, baby!<br>  Oh, man!<br>  <br>  Winner, Peggy Hill!<br>  Winner, Peggy Hill!<br>  Winner, Peggy Hill!<br>  I did it! Guess what, Hank?<br>  <i>We are going to the finals!</i><br>  Look at old Boomhauer,
rolling and dodging and such.<br>  <i>BOOMHAUER: Dang! Somebody
pick up that dang old rock!</i><br>  I tell you, I haven't had this much fun
since our last football road trip.<br>  <i>Remember? When we went to State?</i><br>  And even old Peg was there. Remember?<br>  Yeah, I remember.<br>  Cheering her heart out
when we were down 28-0.<br>  Man, this dang old piece of crap.
Dang old blocked up.<br>  Get the grass out. There it is.<br>  <i></i><br>  I ain't got no fingers!<br>  JOAN: I'm sorry, Peggy.
We have to start the finals.<br>  Okay. As soon as I find my husband.
I mean, coach.<br>  He's probably just refilling my rosin bag.<br>  <i>CISSY: Don't kid yourself. He's probably
too embarrassed to watch me beat you.</i><br>  PEGGY: Cissy Cobb?<br>  That's right, Patches!<br>  Looks like it's you and me in the finals.<br>  <br>  Hank?<br>  <i>BRENT: Hello, and welcome

Only one will be winner.</i><br>  All right, it's gonna be best of three.
I want a clean game.<br>  <i>No foreign words.
No foreign objects. Shake!</i><br>  PEGGY: Oh, Hank.<br>  <i>BRENT: Cissy Cobb is off
to an excellent start in Round 1.</i><br>  <i>ALEXl: Peggy Hill hesitated.</i><br>  <i>That's going to cost her
at least a four-letter word.</i><br>  <i>BRENT: There goes Peggy Hill's pencil!</i><br>  <i>ALEXl: With no coach,
she's really at a disadvantage.</i><br>  <i>BRENT: Incredible!
What a scrapper! What a save!</i><br>  <br>  <i>BRENT: The players will now read their
word lists, starting with Peggy Hill.</i><br>  <i>"Sad, abandoned, abandons...</i><br>  <i>"bad, man..."</i><br>  <i>BRENT: We're in the final round
of this championship match...</i><br>  <i>and Peggy Hill is far behind.</i><br>  Peggy!<br>  <i>ALEXl: Peggy Hill is down
to her last pencil.</i><br>  <i>She has no more pencils in reserve.</i><br>  <i>Everything rides on this pencil!</i><br>  <i>BRENT: This is awful.
I think it's all over for Peggy Hill.</i><br>  <i></i><br>  Hank! Where the hell have you been?<br>  It doesn't matter where I've been.
I figured out where I should be.<br>  Now, let's show them
how we play Boggle in Arlen!<br>  Whatever you say, Coach!<br>  Hoo-yeah!<br>  <br>  <br>  <i>BRENT: Peggy Hill was writing up a storm.
But will it be enough?</i><br>  "Caviar, chinchilla, harpsichord."<br>  <i>ALEXl: What confidence.
She wrote "harpsichord."</i><br>  <i>But not "harp" and not "chord."</i><br>  <i>A very bold gambit.</i><br>  <br>  "Fish, fishes, slaw..."<br>  <i>BRENT: Peggy Hill is using
the opposite strategy.</i><br>  <i>A long list of short words
to narrow the gap.</i><br>  "...churn, churns...<br>  "apron, aprons..."<br>  <i>BRENT: She needs 10 more points,
and she only has one word remaining.</i><br>  "Ain't"?<br>  "Ain't" is not a word! I win!<br>  It ain't "ain't," Cissy Cobb.
The word is "acquaintanceship"...<br>  as in, "It was not my pleasure
to make your acquaintanceship."<br>  I win!<br>  <i>BRENT: What an incredible upset!</i><br>  <i>Peggy Hill is the new
Texas State Boggle champion!</i><br>  <i>Now, a description of the hotel fire safety
procedures with Chuck Mangione.</i><br>  You did it, Peggy, just like you said!
You're in the winner's circle!<br>  And you are right beside me, Hank.<br>  Loser! You're a loser!<br>  Are you feeling sorry for yourself?
Well, you should be!<br>  You know, there's something Coach said
he would do if we ever won the big game.<br>  Oh, yeah? What's that?<br>  BOBBY: Let's go! Let's go! My parents
are gonna be home any minute!<br>  What the hell is going on here?<br>  <br>  This party is officially over!<br>  You kids get out of here

She looks like Fran Drescher.</i><br>  I didn't put it on.
Your dog ate all my cruelty-free makeups.<br>  Honey, calm down.
If she tries it again, you just give her...<br>  a little tap on the fanny

Is that you?<br>  <br>  <i>PEGGY: Do you want to lose a lung?</i><br>  I thought those were the ingredients.<br>  PEGGY: Do not be a smart mouth,
young man! I gave up smoking...<br>  so you'd be free of birth defects,
and this is how you repay me?<br>  Yeah! You don't know
how hard it is to quit!<br>  Your mother and I
went through hell trying to...<br>  Hey, don't recline-o-mite
while I'm talking to you!<br>  PEGGY: Bobby, smoking is
a nasty, filthy habit!<br>  <i>Only trailer trash smoke nowadays!
Do you want to look like trailer trash?</i><br>  That's not fair! I don't smoke!<br>  PEGGY: Luanne!<br>  Lord. Hank, you finish this.<br>  <i>Honey, you are not trash.</i><br>  <i>Just 'cause you grew up in a trailer
and your mama's in prison...</i><br>  All right, Joe Camel,
you wanna smoke, let's go smoke.<br>  HANK: Now look here,
you are gonna smoke this entire carton.<br>  I thought you said
you didn't want me to smoke anymore.<br>  HANK: Oh, this'll take care of that,
believe me.<br>  I wish my daddy had had the parenting
skills to do this for me, I tell you what.<br>  <i>Start puffing, boy.
We gotta get through 200 of these.</i><br>  Joseph, I understand you smoked
your first cigarette today.<br>  I'm sorry, Dad. I'll never smoke again.<br>  Whoa! Hold on, son!<br>  I want you to keep an open mind,
so you can make an informed decision.<br>  If you want, you can read a bloated
government report on smoking...<br>  or go straight to the horse's mouth and
get the facts from the tobacco industry!<br>  For God sakes, Bobby,
what nationality are you?<br>  American.<br>  Then why are you holding your cigarette...<br>  like some kind of European Nazi
in a movie?<br>  Why does it matter?<br>  That's not the right sort of attitude
for you to have.<br>  Whatever you do, you should do right,
even if it's something wrong.<br>  Okay.<br>  HANK: No, I said American.
Here, let me show you.<br>  <br>  That is not how to inhale, Bobby.
You're hot-boxing it.<br>  You gotta inhale slow.<br>  <br>  You see?<br>  <i>Slow like that.</i><br>  BOBBY:  Okay.<br>  Wait a minute.
Let me show you one more time.<br>  <i>Yep, no two ways about it.
Smoking is a filthy, disgusting habit.</i><br>  How come you smoked?<br>  Well, it wasn't as bad for you back then.<br>  Wow!<br>  Pretty keen, huh?<br>  The trick is
to get your thumb under the filter.<br>  But, of course, smoking is wrong...<br>  so you'll have to try this
with a dowel or something.<br>  <br>  <br>  Come on. Only one pack left.<br>  I think I'm gonna barf.<br>  That's what I wanted to hear.
Good job, son.<br>  <br>  When you're finished,
you wanna get that with a hose?<br>  You see, raising a boy
is like fixing a radiator.<br>  You don't talk it into working right...<br>  you have to take it out back
and flush it clean.<br>  <br>  What's wrong, Hank?<br>  Why do you always ask me that?<br>  What's wrong with you?
How does that sound, for a change?<br>  Well, I just asked you once.<br>  Is it about Bobby and that cigarette today?<br>  No, I took care of that.<br>  I made him smoke a whole carton until
he was as sick as he's ever been in his life.<br>  Hank Hill!
What on God's earth were you thinking?<br>  He's just a little boy.<br>  You stunt his growth,
he will stay that way!<br>  Peggy, it's late. I'm tired.
Let's just go to sleep.<br>  Okay.<br>  HANK: I gotta go do some stuff.<br>  I think I might have left the blender on.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Hey there, Enrique.<br>  <i>Sorry, Mr. Hill.
I know I'm not supposed to be smoking.</i><br>  Hell, what's a rule for,
if you can't break it once in a while?<br>  <i>And times got hard
after NAFTA sent the pinata jobs north.</i><br>  That's quite a story, Enrique.<br>  I like stories.<br>  <i>I like stories about pinatas.</i><br>  In fact, I like everything you have to say.<br>  Let's me and you visit
your hometown sometime...<br>  the way you had

Honey, can you take a lunch break?<br>  <i>Sure.</i><br>  <i></i><br>  <br>  <br>  How do you like that?<br>  Is your heart racing?<br>  <i>Are you upset?</i><br>  Now you know how I feel
when you eat my make-ups!<br>  For heaven's sake! That flesh-eating virus
has claimed another victim.<br>  Don't let it worry you, Peggy.<br>  <i>Sometimes you just gotta relax...</i><br>  and enjoy life for all its rich, mellow flavor.<br>  Hank! What are you doing?<br>  <i></i><br>  Well...<br>  Bobby vomited with one pack to go.<br>  I couldn't throw 'em out.

Well, I better check that out.<br>  <br>  Well, I found the "tile."
Thank you very much, Peggy.<br>  And I looked at it...<br>  but there's still some more "tile"
for you to look at.<br>  You know, I think I will save
the rest of my "tile" for after breakfast.<br>  Will you stop talking
about your stupid tile?<br>  If it's so dirty, go clean it!

Nine months inside, remember?<br>  Those were good times, too!<br>  I don't know.<br>  This is happening too fast.
I just don't know.<br>  I do. Come on, Bobby.<br>  You and me can take her.
You go high, I'll go low.<br>  Hey, back off!<br>  PEGGY: I will drop it! I will! I will drop this!<br>  <br>  No!<br>  <br>  Well, look at us. At each other's throats.<br>  And after all we've been through!<br>  This family has survived
fires and twisters...<br>  and every strain of flu

students from second-year students.<br>  Think about that while you study

You don't mess with success.<br>  LUANNE: But I need as much practice

since my last haircut.<br>  - What the heck? I could use a trim.
- Great.<br>  I'll be right with you.<br>  - I can't see any highlights.
- Yes, you can. You love them. Next.<br>  Hey, what's cooking, good...<br>  Well, I do not like it either.<br>  But I am trying to be supportive

a different color?<br>  [Laughs]<br>  Men don't do that.<br>  <i>Sure they do. Even President Reagan did.</i><br>  If Ron Reagan dyed his hair,

I was so girl-crazy...<br>  they called me Ricardo Montalban.<br>  - After the actor.
- Yep.<br>  Joseph's getting to be
a real lady-killer, too.<br>  I reckon he gets that from his old man.<br>  Hey there, Bobby.
I guess they found a cure for the cooties.<br>  I don't know. What are cooties?<br>  When I was a boy, that's what we called
the germs you got from girls.<br>  You mean, like chlamydia?<br>  PEGGY: What are you two talking about?<br>  Bobby was invited
to his first boy-girl party.<br>  A boy-girl party? Already?<br>  I don't think I want to go.<br>  That's just fine, Bobby.
Would you like a juice box?<br>  Wait a minute.<br>  <i>Son, why would you not want to go
to a boy-girl party?</i><br>  Parties are fun, Bobby.<br>  Everybody dresses up.
And you get to touch dance.<br>  Touch dance? I don't know.<br>  - What if I get felt up?

until after I'm married.<br>  - Are you going?
- No.<br>  Joseph's got a birthday in nine weeks.
And I don't want to get partied out.<br>  HANK: Which bolo tie do you want
to wear to the party?<br>  The cow's skull or the bull's skull?<br>  - It doesn't matter. I'm not going.
- What?<br>  BOBBY: It's just a dumb party.
HANK: A dumb party with girls.<br>  I don't like girls.<br>  Peg, honey, close the screen door.<br>  - Can I speak with you?
- In a minute.<br>  PEGGY: In the kitchen.
HANK: This better be about dinner.<br>  PEGGY: Why don't you just drive
him out to Hollywood...<br>  <i>and put him on The Dating Game?</i><br>  HANK: He's almost a teenager.
It ain't normal not to be curious.<br>  It is perfectly normal
for a late bloomer to be a little...<br>  He is not a late bloomer.<br>  How can you even think
something like that about your own son?<br>  He obviously is not ready
to socialize with the opposite sex.<br>  The way you baby him, he never will be.<br>  Do you know anyone
who would like a hot fudge sundae?<br>  LUANNE: Look, I got my practice head.<br>  It's got real hair and everything.<br>  - It's a very nice head...
- Don't touch it!<br>  I can't let anything happen to it

You said noon.<br>  It's 12:15.<br>  Do you have any idea
how long we've been waiting?<br>  HANK: I overslept.
My damned hair's getting so long...<br>  it's rustling on my pillow
and keeping me up all night.<br>  LUANNE: Uncle Hank!<br>  I've never seen you with such long hair.
Come on. Let me trim it.<br>  <i>No. Sorry, I love my long, long hair.</i><br>  Why don't you practice
on your practice head?<br>  But I only get one chance to cut that hair.<br>  Hey! We got a whole busload of

I'll go get my instruments.<br>  Boy, I can't wait for her

and a glass of skim milk.<br>  - I want to slim down for Joseph's party.
- Atta boy!<br>  But you said you didn't want to go.<br>  I changed my mind.<br>  He changed his mind.<br>  Bet I know why.<br>  <i>Bobby Hill has a girlfriend.</i><br>  - He does not. Do you?
- No.<br>  There's nothing
to be embarrassed about, son.<br>  Hell, I'm proud of you.<br>  Hell, I'm proud of you, too, Dad. Bye.<br>  <i>See, Peggy? Our boy is perfectly normal.</i><br>  [Romantic 1960s music playing]<br>  Hey, Courtney.<br>  How you doing, Ashley?<br>  Looking good, Maria.

planned for tonight.<br>  Bobby! Honey, I need some help
with the groceries!<br>  Bobby?<br>  [Mellow instrumental music]<br>  BOBBY: Relax, baby. It's just you and me.<br>  - Bobby!
- Mom!<br>  HANK: You must've got it wrong.
Maybe he just fell on it or something.<br>  Hank, he was kissing it.
I saw it with my own two eyes.<br>  I'm gonna be seeing it
for the rest of my life.<br>  Now, Peggy, it's not your fault.<br>  - Why'd you say that?
- I just said it's not your fault.<br>  Well, it did not need saying.
I know it is not my fault.<br>  If anything, this is your fault.<br>  You made him go
to that camp with no toilet doors.<br>  Don't point your finger at me, woman.<br>  You're the one who parks him
in front of the TV...<br>  and makes him watch all them Muppets.<br>  They got frogs kissing pigs.<br>  What did they think was gonna happen?<br>  We are not gonna get anywhere
by attacking each other.<br>  We have to do the sensible thing.<br>  - We'll move to Berlin.
- What?<br>  Bobby will be accepted there.<br>  I read somewhere that Germans,
they're a very tolerant people.<br>  Their culture admires all kinds of freaks.<br>  Our boy is not a freak. He's just confused.<br>  I'm gonna cut those apron strings...<br>  you got him tied down with
and set that boy straight, I tell you what.<br>  HANK: Bobby?<br>  <i>We are heading down the hall
towards your room, son.</i><br>  [Knocking]<br>  <i>That's us knocking, your mother and me.</i><br>  Come in.<br>  HANK: Okay, then. We're coming on in.<br>  Bobby, how would you like
to go for a car ride?<br>  Look, Bobby, I'm as open-minded
as the next guy.<br>  But just so you know, most states
won't let you marry a plastic head.<br>  I don't want to marry it.<br>  I just needed to practice my first kiss,
so I don't look like an idiot.<br>  You're kissing a plastic head,
and you're afraid of looking like an idiot?<br>  <i>Son, I'm doing this for your own good.</i><br>  You're just using this head as a crutch.<br>  It's not a crutch, Dad.<br>  It's something I've come to rely on
to help me through life.<br>  Well, I'll make you a deal.
Go to your party.<br>  Afterwards, if you still want this head,
you can have it.<br>  But I won't need it after the party.<br>  Exactly.<br>  HANK: Let this be the end of it.<br>  <i>[Snoring]</i><br>  [Dog barking]<br>  <i>[Snoring]</i><br>  [Lock opening]<br>  <i>[Snoring]</i><br>  [Door creaking]<br>  Well, that just tears it.

PEGGY: I don't know.<br>  BOBBY: No, Dad! No!<br>  <i>[Saw running]</i><br>  Hank!<br>  <i>Stop, Hank. Please.</i><br>  LUANNE: Oh, no. Please, not my head!<br>  LUANNE: My test! What about my test?<br>  TEACHER: Passable.<br>  <i>Good.</i><br>  First, this is not the plastic head
you were issued.<br>  <i>Second, just look at the way you shaved...</i><br>  <i>against the grain here, here, and here.</i><br>  And these are the worst sideburns
I've seen since Chair 3...<br>  which makes me suspect you cheated.<br>  <i>F.</i><br>  That means, you fail.<br>  What a bitch.<br>  Don't cry, Luanne.
This is the best haircut I ever had.<br>  <i>The hair is all nice and uniform...</i><br>  which is tough 'cause I have
bumps here and here.<br>  LUANNE: I noticed.<br>  <i>I layered on the upslopes
and tapered on the down.</i><br>  Yep. This is my all-time favorite haircut.<br>  Thanks, Uncle Hank.<br>  Miss Platter?<br>  I'm sorry.<br>  I've been mean and unfair.<br>  I guess I just got so far from the hair...<br>  and so into the whole power trip
of running the academy...<br>  I forgot the most important principle
of the beautician's art.<br>  Repeat business and referrals.<br>  You pleased your customer. You pass.<br>  [Class applauding]<br>  [Cheering and whistling]<br>  Come here, Ladybird.
Come here. You're so pretty.<br>  [Makes kissing noises]<br>  PEGGY: Bobby, your father told me you
were just kissing the head for practice.<br>  <i>Now, I know he made that up
to protect me.</i><br>  <i>But I am your mother.</i><br>  And I have decided
that I am gonna love you no matter what.<br>  Okay.<br>  I realize I am just as much to blame
for your condition...<br>  as the media and the devil.<br>  I have been overprotective.
You're not a baby anymore.<br>  You are gonna have a long
and interesting life ahead of you.<br>  And it's time for me to just let go.<br>  <i>Just let go. So you go on.</i><br>  You go to the party. That's right.<br>  Just spread your wings
and fly away, little bird.<br>  <i>[Swallows]</i><br>  KAHN JR: Watch out!<br>  Hey, aren't you going to Joseph's party?<br>  I can't. It's a make-out party.<br>  And my dad took away my plastic head.<br>  What a buzz kill.
I've been practicing, too. Look.<br>  What a great idea.<br>  I want my first kiss to be perfect.<br>  You know, something sweet
I can keep with me my whole life.<br>  Hey, Bobby, can we practice
on each other?<br>  - You want to kiss me?
- No, just practice.<br>  Okay.<br>  Close your eyes.<br>  This is stupid.<br>  Let's try it with our eyes open.<br>  Was that right?<br>  I think so. Do I have any hickies?<br>  I don't see anything.<br>  MINH: Kahn Jr., come home for dinner.
Your prawn's getting cold.<br>  Well, I better get to that party.<br>  Hey, good luck.<br>  Thanks.<br>  <i>[Sighs]</i><br>  [Crickets chirping]<br>  DALE: All right!
